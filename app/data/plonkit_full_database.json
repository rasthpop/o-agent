Front plates are required in Alaska.\n- The Alaskan highway shield has an image of the **Big Dipper constellation** on the bottom left.\n- Trees in Alaska are generally **thinner** and have less broad leaves than those seen in the other 49 states.\n- On a lot of the Alaskan coverage you will be able to see tall, **snow covered mountains**.\n- In most of the US, Generation 2 is rare. However, Alaska has a fair amount of **Generation 2 coverage**.\n- Alaska has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front, with the front of the white car being very visible. The blur can also be fully transparent.\n- Alaska is the only state in the US where **shitcam** **coverage **is prevalent. This coverage is lower resolution with more faded colours, compared to other camera generations. Also, a large blur can be seen at the bottom of the page."

These areas feature relatively low amounts of forest undergrowth and shorter trees.\n- The Alaskan towns in the Alexander Archipelago, on the British Columbia border have a unique look. Tall mountains with **lush green forests** can be seen in the background, with the majority of buildings made of wood. In addition, Generation 2 coverage is often overcast and misty. NOTE: Coastal areas of Oregon and Washington can have a similar appearance in terms of landscape and foliage.\n- The only two major **urban areas** in Alaska are Anchorage and Fairbanks.\n- Most of the **suburban areas** in Alaska are in and around Anchorage.These areas feature wide roads, commercial districts, and sometimes heavy traffic. Mountains can commonly be seen in the distance. NOTE: Fairbanks has some similar areas, but mountains are less prevalent.\n- **Aspen trees** (Populus tremuloides) can be found in lower elevation areas of interior and south-central regions of Alaska. These trees have white bark and rounded leaves.\n- Due to Alaska’s very cold climate; **agricultural fields** are mainly found in the south of the state, mostly in the Matanuska Valley and Kenai Peninsula.\n- The **Alaskan pipeline** which is usually visible from main roads, can be seen at these points. This is an easy way to identify Alaska as there are no similar pipelines in the rest of the US."

NOTE: This map shows all places where this camera can be found. Keep in mind coverage may be updated in some places, therefore you may come across regular coverage in places highlighted here.\n- The North end of the Dalton Highway features a **flat** and **snowy landscape** and an overcast sky. A small ridge of hills can be seen to the west of the highway in certain spots.\n- The Denali highway, stretching from Cantwell to Paxson in central Alaska, is a mostly **gravel highway** in the ‘Alaska’ mountain range. This road runs generally east to west, is covered in the generation 2 camera, and was taken in late summer, so wildflowers and green shrubby plants are common.\n- The Steese Highway is another gravel highway that goes from Fairbanks to the town of ‘Central.’ Similar to the Denali highway, this road runs generally east to west and is covered in generation 2. The difference, however, is that the **mountains** along this road are noticeably **lower** than the ones adjacent to the Denali Highway.\n- Highway 5, from the Yukon border to Tetlin Junction, can be recognized by the **foggy, rainy** weather, and Generation 2 camera. NOTE: The Top of the World Highway on the Canadian side also has similar weather, but is mostly paved and has no outer lines, unlike the American side, which is only paved west of Chicken, and does have outer lines.\n- Prudhoe Bay, the northernmost town in America covered by street view, can be recognized by **cold, dead** landscape, overcast clouds and lack of tall buildings. A second Google car can sometimes be seen.\n- Nome, Unalakleet and Galena are three isolated Alaskan towns which are covered only by trekker. The trekker’s **lime green hat** or black and white beanie can be seen. NOTE: The trekker’s black and white bandana can only be seen in Nome."

NOTE: Albania is the only European country with red on the left side of the licence plate. Furthermore, Italian licence plates also have blue strips on both sides, however Italian front plates are distinctly shorter.\n- ‘**Rifts**’ can commonly be seen in Albanian coverage, due to poor stitching. NOTE: Rifts are also equally common in Montenegro, and can rarely be seen in various other countries.\n- Albanian bollards have a **black top** with a red and grey reflector. The bottom is painted white. NOTE: Italy uses the same kind of bollards.\n- These pole tops, with an **upside down triangle** shape, are a good clue for Albania. NOTE: Serbia, Czechia, Slovakia and Romania use similar pole tops.\n- Other, more simple Albanian pole tops will often have **horizontal bars**. NOTE: If you are not sure between Montenegro or Albania and see these poles, guess Albania.\n- Albanian chevrons are **white on black**. NOTE: Within southern Europe this chevron is also used by Italy, Greece, and Spain. Montenegro uses two chevrons, both of which are different from the Albanian chevron: black on white and red on yellow.\n- The backs of road signs are often painted **black**. NOTE: This is also common in Italy and Romania.\n- The “S” on Albanian stop signs feature a **distinct shape**; the ends of the S are quite short and have the same angle as the middle, rather than being vertical. This is also sometimes seen on directional signs. NOTE: Italian stops signs and directional signs have the same feature.\n- The numbers on speed signs are written in a **bold font**. NOTE: The font is much thinner on speed signs in Montenegro.\n- These **flat and wide** guardrail endings that bend away from the road can often be found in Albania. NOTE: The same endings are found in Italy.\n- **Albanian** is not very closely related to any other European languages, and therefore has a fairly distinct look. Words often contain the letter Ë, ë, and sometimes Ç ç.\n- The Albanian word for street is **rruga**.\n- Albania is generally a **mountainous** country, with a **Mediterranean** climate and vegetation. In between the hills and mountains, you can sometimes find more flat, agricultural valleys. The mountains are usually quite green, sometimes with patches of exposed rock visible.\n- Albania has a lot of **exposed red soil** next to roads. NOTE: This is less common in Montenegro. Greece on the other hand also has a fair amount of similar-looking red soil, especially closer to the Albanian border.\n- You will see a lot of **cylinder-shaped water tanks** on the roofs of buildings. NOTE: This is less common in Montenegro. Some parts of Turkey also have a lot of similar-looking water tanks.\n- Albania has a lot of **Italian-style buildings**: pastel colours, orange tiled roofs, and blocky shapes with lots of balconies.\n- **Mercedes** is the most popular car brand in Albania, by quite a margin.

You can also use this Maps layer to look at the coverage in more detail (credits to icraig1205)._\n- Albania is generally a very mountainous country. This map shows the elevation and relief. - Low-lying areas are mostly concentrated in the west, around Shkodër, Tirana and Vlorë. This part of the country is characterised by agricultural flatlands and low, undulating hills. Note that the highland plateau around Korçë in the southeast is also very flat. - The highest mountains can be found in the far north and the far south.

It goes through a **wide valley** with fairly tall mountains on either side.\n- Albania only has a few divided highways covered on Street View. All of these and how to differentiate them will be covered in the tips below. The most easily recognisable divided highway is the A1 between Fushë Milot and Thumanë, which is the only one with a **triple guardrail**.\n- The sections of the SH2 between Durrës and Tirana and of the SH4 between Lushnjë and Rrogozhinë are both divided by **simple concrete blocks**.\n- In Tirana, Durrës and on the A3 and SH3 south of Tirana you can find highways which are divided by concrete blocks, with **grass and greenery **in between.\n- Most of the SH4 between Durrës and Fier is divided by a **basic double guardrail**. The road does not go through any mountains.\n- The E851 is the only divided road with a basic double guardrail that goes directly **through mountains**. NOTE: A section of the A3 goes through the mountains but is either divided by a double guardrail with a fence above, or with concrete blocks.\n- The A2 north of Vlorë can be recognised by the fairly flat surroundings combined with the double guardrail with an **extra tall fence** dividing the highway.\n- The city of Lezhë can often be recognised by the **old castle** at the top of a tall hill.\n- Gjirokaster is a city situated on the **western hillside** of a wide valley."

NOTE: Their look may vary significantly, depending on your location within the country. More details can be found in the region-guessing section.\n- Australian bollards are white, with a **red reflector** on the front, and a grey reflector on the back. NOTE: New Zealand uses a bollard where the red reflector wraps around the back, meaning the reflector goes from end to end while the Australian one stops in the middle.\n- Australia drives on the **left**. NOTE: A handful of other countries also drive on the left. See this infographic for more information.\n- Australia uses almost exclusively **white road lines**, with a few rare exceptions in alpine regions such as Mount Kosciuszko and Mount Hotham. NOTE: If you are considering guessing in Australia, but see yellow outside lines or a yellow middle line, you will probably be in South Africa or New Zealand respectively. Note that New Zealand can have all white road lines as well.\n- Outside lines in Australia sometimes feature **rumble strips** that look like small white stripes perpendicular to the road line. NOTE: Northern Territory roads very rarely have rumble strips. In addition, you can find similar rumble strips in New Zealand.\n- **Give-way signs** in Australia have a white border and black text. NOTE: New Zealand’s give-way signs use red, instead of black, text. Give-way signs are very rarely seen in South Africa.\n- Australia uses **white on black** and **black on yellow** chevrons.\n- **Green **signs with white arrows on either side can be seen at intersections which show nearby towns or cities. A number indicating the number of **kilometres **away the town can sometimes be seen.\n- Australian speed limit signs have black text in a red circle on a large white **rectangle**.

A map of these by state can be seen here. Keep in mind, **not all** phone numbers will include an area code in front of it.\n- Each state has a **unique **bus stop design. These are quite common in urban rounds, so are worth learning. Darwin bus stops are usually concrete shelters. NOTE: The designs may vary slightly, but should still be recognisable. There are multiple versions of Tasmanian bus stops, but most of them should have the word ‘metro’ on it. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- The iconic **Stobie pole**, made of steel and concrete, is specific to South Australia. The pole tops (trident or rotated letter “E”) are also unique.

At times, other extensions can be seen on these poles.\n- Poletops in Tasmania often consist of a **thin metal crossbar** **bent 90 degrees** to form an **L-shape.** NOTE: Regular Australian crossbars are usually made out of wood.\n- Circular **blue** stickers can be found on Queensland poles. You may occasionally see the same type of sticker in a different colour, or with the colour almost completely faded. NOTE: Blue stickers can also be found on French poles.\n- These **black markings** are specific to electricity poles in Queensland. They are often accompanied by diagonal numbers.\n- **Olive-green possum guards** are only found on electricity poles in Tasmania. NOTE: Possum guards are found all over Australia. The colour is what distinguishes them.\n- Poles in Western Australia often have **green **painted bases, and sometimes a white sticker or a red and white band attached.\n- Reflectors that are **shorter **in height than the regular ones are most common in Queensland and South Australia.

It features dark red soil, as well as rich green grass and trees. The tree trunks are typically black.\n- **Termite mounds** can sometimes be seen in the Northern Territory and rarely northern WA and QLD. They appear as brown, spiky formations rising out of the ground.\n- The area around Warramboo in SA to Madura in WA has a unique landscape. Vegetation is quite **dry **and is made up of shrubs and **wide crowned eucalyptus**. In addition, the soil is sandy with a slight orange tint. The dry area east of Adelaide and into northwestern Victoria has a similar landscape, with the same vegetation but usually with **whiter soil**. NOTE: The soil gets more red in the WA side. Redder soil can also be seen more inland on the Victorian side around Mildura. In addition, the Nullarbor Highway has a distinct landscape.\n- **Lush green or golden **fields can be found in this band from the south of the Yorke Peninsula to Echuca. In the SA side, the landscape should be drier than the Victorian side and more wide crowned eucalyptus can be seen. On the Victorian side, the trees generally have more leaves and are taller. NOTE: The area near Mount Gambier has a distinct landscape. For more information, see below.\n- Coastal northern Queensland is very **tropical**. Typical vegetation consists of palm trees and dark green vegetation.\n- **Sugarcane plantations** are very common in Northern Queensland, due to its tropical climate. NOTE: Sugarcane plantations can be seen as far south as northern NSW, however are most commonly found in northern Queensland. For a detailed overview, see this map.\n- The landscape in inland NSW is mostly flat, and the soil gets **redder **the more inland you go. Vegetation consists of mostly dry **pale-green shrubs**. Further east and on the Queensland and Victorian borders, the climate gets more temperate but is still quite dry and more eucalyptus trees can be seen, with the soil transitioning into a more sandy colour as well as more hills being visible.\n- Tasmania has a **cool temperate** climate which is uncommon in the rest of Australia and is comparable to central-southern Chile or New Zealand. Typical landscape consists of green rolling hills that can look dry in winter coverage. Eucalyptus trees can be seen on the side of roads and on hills in the distance. Rural Tasmania is also quite hilly with dense eucalyptus forests making up the landscape. NOTE: Certain areas of Victoria can look similar so make sure to look for other clues.\n- **Generation 2** **cannot** be found in the Northern Territory.\n- Australia is home to dozens of **rare Google cars**, which can usually be found in natural reserves. Most rare Google cars with **snorkels **are located in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. The snorkels are dark grey or black extensions to the side of the car, to keep the engine dry when submerged in water. NOTE: The only snorkels outside NSW and ACT are found on two cars in Western Australia (1 and 2). _GeoHints has a complete overview of all rare cars, which can be found on this page._\n- For country streak purposes, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands **are counted** as part of Australia. For example, clicking Australia on Christmas Island counts as a country streak.

NOTE: To differentiate Cairns from other northern Queensland towns, Cairns has many high rise buildings and should feel quite urban. Divided roads are also common in downtown Cairns, and only commonly seen in Mackay further south, where it is less tropical and more flat.\n- The area around **Mount Gambier**, SA features white soil and extensive pine tree plantations, making it recognisable.\n- **Kangaroo Island** in South Australia tends to have a distinct look. The vegetation mostly consists of bushes and low, stubby eucalyptus trees with puffy clusters of leaves. The orange soil colour is reminiscent of Western Australia. In addition, the island only has Generation 2 and Generation 4 coverage.\n- The Nullarbor Highway (Latin for “no tree”) can be easily recognized thanks to the flatness, overall grey look and **very low vegetation**. NOTE: Use the road angle or road lines to determine whether you are on the WA or SA side.\n- On most of the Northern Territory section of the Barkly Highway and a small part of the Queensland section, a **wire **can be seen on the left side of the car.\n- Dorat Road (23) in the Northern Territory can be easily recognized thanks to its distinct Darwin area landscape and **lack** of road lines.\n- The Sturt Highway from Wentworth to Wagga Wagga can have **triple **broken centre lines. NOTE: Triple broken centre lines can also be found on other major roads in NSW, such as the Gwydir Highway. However, they are most common on the Sturt Highway.\n- The Stuart Highway from Alice Springs to around Pimba, SA can be easily recognized by its **bright orange** dirt, short trees and blue car Generation 4. NOTE: Use the road angle and whether there are rumble strips to determine whether you are in NT or SA. Rumble strips are much rarer on the NT side.\n- You can sometimes see **sloped **kerbs in Perth, where it gradually declines to the road, whilst in other cities kerbs go straight down at a 90 degree angle.\n- Melbourne poles commonly feature these white, rectangular stickers, with a smaller **blue square **inside it.\n- All-**yellow **road lines can be seen on roads around Mount Kosciuszko. In addition, a unique white truck with a **snorkel**, and cab guard can be found.

The colour of the reflector is **(dark) red or dark grey**. Many bollards also feature a small nipple-shaped black cap on the top. Bollards sometimes have a snow pole on top. NOTE: Slovenia and Montenegro use the same bollards, but with bright red reflectors instead of grey or dark red. Germany uses simple white bollards with grey reflectors.\n- Austria uses two colour schemes for **chevrons**: - white on red - red on yellow NOTE: Germany mostly uses red on white chevrons, and rarely red on yellow.\n- Round **wooden** poles are the most common type of pole found in Austria.\n- Most of Austria is **mountainous** and covered in forests. However, some areas in the east and northeast are much more flat and agricultural.\n- Alpine architecture is common in Austria and other countries in the Alps. Houses commonly have distinct **light **coloured walls, with **wooden **elements such as balconies or panelling around the top floor, with dark-coloured wooden roofs that extend outward. The roofs can sometimes be angled downward at the front and back. In addition, houses are also often multi-storeyed. NOTE: Germany uses similar architecture in its southern states.\n- The official language of Austria is **German**. The German language uses the special letters Ä, Ö, Ü and ß.

In addition, German is spoken in East Belgium and the Italian province of South Tyrol.\n- You can tell the three German-speaking countries apart by **camera meta **alone: - Austria only has **Generation 3** and Generation 4 coverage (the only exceptions being Generation 2 on one road in Burgenland, and several ski resort trekkers). - Germany only has Generation 4 coverage. (the only exceptions being spills and trekkers) - Switzerland car coverage is always low-cam. This can be recognized by the much bigger car blur.\n- Austria also has generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Western Europe also has smallcam.\n- Direction signs have a white background, a **blue outline**, and a unique font.\n- Similar white signs with a** **blue outline and unique font can also be seen at the **entrance of towns**.

The west, particularly the divisions of Rajshahi, Khulna and Dhaka, is dominated by hip roofs made of sheet metal. The states of Rangpur and Chittagong tend to have mixed roofs.\n- In the east, you will commonly see sheet metal roofs with a** triangular \"window\"** just below the ridge of the roof. The state of Sylhet will exclusively have this style, which can also be seen in Chittagong, Mymensingh, eastern Rangpur and northern Dhaka.\n- **Tiled roofs** are uncommon in Bangladesh, but the ones you do see are of West Bengal origin, and are thus only found on the Indian border in the state of Khulna.\n- Rice is the main agricultural crop in Bangladesh and is planted twice a year. The different rice seasons can be told apart by the height and colour of the rice and are very useful for regionguessing. **Short green rice** that is barely sticking out of the water is known as **early growth rice**. Early growth rice can be seen in the states of** **Khulna, Mymensingh and south of Padma River in Dhaka. NOTE: Beware that this, and the following tips, are only accurate in Generation 4 coverage.\n- Slightly taller rice, in the **middle of growing**, which still remains **green**, can be seen in the states of Rangpur, Barishal and Chittagong.\n- **Fully-grown rice** is characterised by being noticeably taller, as well as having a** yellow** or **orange colour** and **fluffier tips** - the fluffiness signifies that the rice is ripe. Fully-grown rice is mostly seen in the state of Rajshahi, but it is also present in Rangpur and Chittagong.\n- **Harvested rice** can be identified by its **beige or brown colour** and **shorter, cut down appearance**. It can be seen alongside fully-grown, unharvested rice as well as freshly planted early growth rice in adjacent fields. This is most commonly seen in the states of Sylhet and southern Khulna.\n- Rice fields require some **rest time**, so it's natural to come across some off-season **barren, empty fields** without rice altogether. Off-season fields are mostly seen in the state of Dhaka, north of Padma River.\n- Vast rice fields with almost nothing else in view can be seen in the border area between the states of Dhaka, Mymensingh and Sylhet.\n- While most of Bangladesh is almost completely flat, in the eastern parts of Chittagong you may find fairly tall, forested and uncultivated **hills**.\n- A sizable east-west ridge can be seen on the Indian border from the northern parts of Sylhet and eastern Mymensingh. It is often obscured or diminished by heavy haze.\n- **Corn** tends to be planted in the west of Bangladesh - large and medium-sized fields can be found in Rajshahi, Rangpur, western Mymensingh and northern Khulna. Smaller patches of corn can be found in the south of Barishal, usually adjacent to other crops.\n- Jute is a tall-growing green crop which gets dried and used in the making of rugs, bags and other goods. Because of when the coverage was taken, jute can almost exclusively be found on Street View in Rangpur. In its dried state it can be found hanging off fences and drying on the roads anywhere in the country.\n- **Canola** is a** **low-growing crop with **yellow flowers** that is used to make cooking oil. It is usually planted during the off-season for rice, making it extremely common north of Padma river in the state of Dhaka.\n- **Tea production** in Bangladesh is concentrated in the highlands of southern Sylhet and, rarely, Chittagong.\n- Standalone **fruit trees** in Bangladesh are most commonly seen in the states of Rajshahi and Rangpur.** Fruit orchards** with systematically planted trees, however, are concentrated near the Indian border in both states.\n- **Sunflower fields** are found in the south of Barishal state.\n- Fields of **watermelons **can also be found in the south of Barishal.\n- **Eucalyptus trees** are** **tall trees with lush crowns and **ivory-coloured trunks**. In Bangladesh they are more common in the north, with** **Rangpur, Rajshahi and Mymensingh being the most likely states.\n- **Blossoming trees** are tied to coverage and seasonal metas in Bangladesh, and are only found in the states where coverage was taken during spring time - Khulna, Mymensingh and southern Dhaka. NOTE: Beware that this is only accurate in Generation 4 coverage.\n- **Beach Sheoaks **(Casuarina equisetifolia) are thin evergreen trees** **with **thin, long, drooping branchlets. **Like the name suggests, they are mostly observed in coastal regions - along the coast of the Teknaf Peninsula and around Noakhali city in Chittagong.\n- For legal reasons, Google has added small labels noting their copyright on all Street View coverage. These labels contain a year, typically the year when the coverage was released, which can be used to regionguess Bangladesh. Generation 4 coverage with **2022** written on the copyright labels can be found in Mymensingh, Dhaka and less commonly Chittagong. NOTE: Beware that the copyright labels will rarely get updated to a later year, without any other changes to the coverage.\n- Similarly, Generation 4 coverage with **2023** written on the copyright labels can be found in Rangpur, Rajshahi, Khulna, Barishal, Sylhet and less commonly Chittagong. NOTE: 2024 and 2025 now make up around half of all copyright dates. These can be found all over the country.\n- **Shitcam coverage** is only found in and around Dhaka.\n- **Generation 3** coverage with the **white** Street View car can be found in Dhaka, Chattogram as well as on the highway connecting them.\n- **Generation 3** coverage with the **striped **Street View car can be found mostly on yellow roads west of Dhaka."

Instead of learning a lot of country-specific clues, it is more practical to simply memorise what the trekker looks like. You can recognise trekkers by the fact that the camera feels a bit lower than the usual Google car. In Belarus’ case, the trekker is also mostly on pedestrian-only roads. _You can find information about the border spill coverage in the Spillover Guide._\n- The Minsk trekker features a **historic part of the city**, with well-maintained classical European architecture. Many buildings have white or pastel coloured walls. Most of the roads you see are pedestrian-only.\n- The Holy Spirit Cathedral features prominently in the coverage. Its two towers can often be seen from far away.\n- The pavement which the trekker walks on in Minsk is mostly **grey rectangular tiles**. On a small part, there are pink-ish tiles in a specific pattern.\n- Signs will be in Belarusian or Russian. Both languages use the Cyrillic alphabet. NOTE: The letters ў and і are not found in Russian.\n- The Minsk centre street signs are **sea-green**, and can be seen almost everywhere. NOTE: If you are close enough to the sign, you can make out the Cyrillic letters “вул (vul)”, the Belarusian name for “street”."

You can recognise this distinct colour even through the blur.\n- Belgium uses **white** bollards with a **yellow rectangular reflector **on the front and white on the back. A second type of bollard is dark brown with two red stripes at the top. Occasionally, other bollards can be seen. NOTE: Denmark uses similar white bollards, but they have a red stripe at the top and the reflector is not rectangular. The dark brown bollard with two red stripes can also be seen in the Netherlands.\n- Belgium uses A-type guardrails with **yellow **reflectors. NOTE: In Europe, only Spain, Andorra, and Belgium use these reflectors. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- Most poles in Belgium are concrete, square shaped, and have tiny holes running up them. They often have** small metal wrappings** around them. The second most common type of pole has **oval-shaped holes**. You can find many different types of concrete poles in Belgium. NOTE: The small metal wrappings can be found in France as well.\n- Directional signs in Belgium are most often blue or white.\n- Road signs often have an additional **small blue sign**. In other European countries, these small signs are usually just white.\n- Belgium uses pedestrian crossing signs without any stripes, but with **two horizontal dotted lines**. The man on the sign has a **square head**. NOTE: France and the Netherlands use a pedestrian sign with a regular zebra crossing with five vertical stripes.\n- Kilometre markers in Belgium are often green, but can have red text as well.\n- Belgium uses white chevrons, with a red arrow. NOTE: The Netherlands also uses this chevron. You will not see these in France.\n- A lot of rural roads in Belgium are made out of **concrete slabs**, almost like you would see in the Philippines or Thailand. NOTE: The Netherlands almost never uses concrete slabs for roads.\n- Belgium uses all **white **road lines. These can be continuous or broken.

NOTE: This is more common in the North and West of the country.\n- Houses in the South of the country use a lot of stone, have gray tones and generally look more French.\n- Signposts in Belgium are often **orange**. The backs of signs are also sometimes orange. This is unique to Belgium.\n- Street name signs in Belgium are very diverse, and often unique to a city. Most common colours are **white **and **dark** **blue**. They often have the** town or city name** written on them. NOTE: These signs often have variable designs, but most of them are fairly short and tall. In comparison, Dutch street signs are almost always much longer than they are tall.\n- **Town entry signs** in Belgium are white with a black border. They also mention the name of the city or municipality in bold, black text.\n- Priority signs in Belgium have an **orange **diamond and are much **smaller **than in other countries.\n- Bus stops are always marked by **yellow signposts**. Bus shelters often have **yellow roofs**.\n- Traffic lights are most often supported by black-and-yellow or red-and-white **striped poles**. NOTE: The regional differences are discussed in Step 2.\n- Belgium uses these **red** water hydrants signs with the letter **H **on top. NOTE: You can also find these in Germany.\n- Almost all roads (big or small) in Belgium use **gutters **on both sides. This is much less common in neighbouring countries.\n- Belgian bicycle paths have short dashed outer lines.\n- After Germany, Belgium is the next country in which you can find the most **blurred houses.**\n- Coverage with a** red car** and a **long antenna **can rarely be seen in Belgium. NOTE: This is much more common in Ukraine.\n- Belgium also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Western Europe also has smallcam."

NOTE: The Ardennes extend partially into France, Luxembourg, and Germany.\n- The coastal plain is extremely flat and consists of so-called **polders**, which are man-made fields at or below sea level, surrounded by many waterways. This landscape is situated near the North Sea coast, as well as near the western part of the border with the Netherlands, particularly around Antwerp. NOTE: This part of Belgium is especially often confused with the Netherlands. Carefully look around for clues to distinguish the two countries if you find yourself in this landscape.\n- Many parts of the Belgian **North Sea coast** are lined by apartment blocks, in a manner that is often derisively referred to as a “wall” of buildings by locals. Near the coast, you will also sometimes be able to spot a dune landscape, with low bushes, long grass and sandy soil."

All of the country was covered by a solid **white Google car with no antenna**. NOTE: In Latin America, white cars with no antenna can also be found in Peru and Chile.\n- Many buildings in Bolivia consist of** large red bricks**. Buildings often have an ‘unfinished' look. NOTE: This style of architecture is also common in parts of Peru.\n- **Middle road lines** can be all-yellow, yellow and white, or all-white, while **outer road lines** are always white. NOTE: Road lines in Chile are always all-white or all-yellow, never a combination of the two. In Peru, you can find roads having outer lines with no middle line. Such outer line-only roads are very rare in Bolivia.\n- Bolivia has a lot of standard asphalt roads, but **concrete slab roads** are also fairly common.\n- There are also a lot of **cobblestone roads**. These roads often have a specific pattern, with several neat lines of stones separating the more disorganised cobblestones in between.\n- Bolivia typically uses **bulky, white square signposts**. NOTE: Peru typically uses black and white striped “zebra” signposts.\n- Guardrails sometimes feature **yellow and black **markings. These markings always have the yellow stripes on the outside. NOTE: Peru has similar markings. However, in Peru, the markings have the inverse colour scheme: the black stripes are always on the outside.\n- Two types of **utility poles** are common in Bolivia: - Round concrete poles, often with small pinholes near the top. - Wooden poles. Poles in Bolivia are very inconsistent and should not be relied on too much. Poles can have a variety of pole tops. On rare occasions, you can find Argentina-style concrete poles.\n- Many wooden utility poles, particularly in the eastern parts of Bolivia’s Street View coverage, are noticeably **curvy **and look like they are made from locally sourced tree trunks. NOTE: While you may see slightly bent poles in other places, extremely curvy poles are a very good clue for Bolivia.\n- **Kilometre markers** are black and white. The top part is black and features the abbreviation ‘Km’, while the bottom part is white and shows the distance. These markers do not have road numbers. NOTE: They can look somewhat similar to Argentinian road markers, especially from a distance. The main difference is that the markers in Argentina feature a road number.\n- Many Bolivians wear **traditional clothing**, especially women. Folk dress for women typically consists of bowler hats, colourful shawls, and big pleated skirts (pollera). NOTE: Similar folk dress can sometimes be found in parts of Peru, especially those close to Bolivia.\n- At the time Bolivia was covered by Street View, its ruling political party was the Movimiento al Socialismo (**MAS**). Political graffiti often features the words MAS and **Evo**, short for then-president Evo Morales. Additionally, many random objects are painted in the party’s colours: **black, white, and a large blue field**. This distinctive colour scheme is a good clue for Bolivia.\n- Bolivia has a **second official flag**, called the Wiphala. It is a square patchwork of seven diagonally arranged colours. It is sometimes seen on government buildings and project signs.\n- In urban areas, you will often see ads for the telecom company **Tigo**, with its distinct blue logo. Crucially, this company does not operate in Peru, meaning it can help you solve urban 50-50s. NOTE: This company does operate in several other Latin American countries, so only use this tip to differentiate between Peru and Bolivia.\n- If all else fails, and you have a tough 50-50, it can help to look at the colour of the rocks and soil, which often have a distinct **reddish tint** in Bolivia, more so than the other Andean countries.

                "description": "- Coverage in Bolivia is **very limited**, both in geographic scope and the density of roads covered. Only the central and central-western parts of the country have coverage. Most coverage is found in and around the six main cities of La Paz or El Alto, Cochabamba, Oruro, Sucre, Potosi, and Santa Cruz. These aforementioned six cities have in-depth side-street coverage. Outside these cities, coverage is mostly limited to main roads. Beware that “main road” is a relative concept in Bolivia: many of these, even some that are marked yellow on the map, have large unpaved sections.\n- The **Altiplano** (“high plain”) is an immense highland plateau that dominates most of western Bolivia. It is covered in grasslands that range from green to arid. Some parts are suitable for agriculture, whereas other parts are extremely dry. Grass growing in tufts is common (sometimes referred to as “Bolivian hedgehogs” in the community). NOTE: While it is generally fairly flat, you will often see hills and mountains around you. However, as a general rule, the road itself will be mostly flat.\n- The grasslands of the Altiplano tend to look more **lush** in the more northern half: the area close to El Alto and La Paz. NOTE: Due to seasonal coverage, there are some exceptions to this, but in general this is a good rule of thumb to distinguish between the different parts of the Altiplano.\n- Conversely, the Altiplano looks more **arid** in the more southern half: around Oruro, and the roads going southwest towards Chile. NOTE: There is one major exception to this: one driving side of the divided part of Ruta 1 looks somewhat green all the way up to Oruro (due to this coverage being captured in a different season).\n- **Lake Titicaca**, on the border with Peru, is the most significant body of water in Bolivia. It is located entirely within the Altiplano. It can be seen from two roads: - The section of Ruta 1 between Desaguadero and Guaqui. Here, the lake will always be to your north. - The section of Ruta 2 between San Pablo de Tiquina and Batallas. Here, the lake will mostly be to your south or west. The landscape around Titicaca is very green, compared to most of the western half of Bolivia.\n- If you are surrounded by tall mountains, you are likely in the Andes, which goes roughly northwest to southeast in between the Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest. NOTE: The Altiplano has several smaller and solitary mountains.\n- The area east of the Andes is very **green and tropical**, with lots of **agriculture** – especially around Santa Cruz. This area is mostly very flat, though you will see large hills on some of the roads closer to the Andes. The soil tends to have a pink colour.\n- Within this tropical area, coverage on **unpaved roads** is only found around Santa Cruz. These roads again prominently have the pink soil that is very characteristic of the area east of Andes.\n- Aside from being a useful identifier for the country, **cobblestone roads** are mainly found in and southeast of Cochabamba. They also appear around Sucre and, very rarely, in La Paz."

However, despite being located right next to each other, they each have a very different look. See the tips below for more information.\n- La Paz is a very **hilly** city. Most of La Paz itself is situated in meandering valleys, surrounded by hills that often tend to be covered in **green vegetation** (as opposed to the more dry hillsides found in many other Bolivian urban areas).\n- Downtown La Paz is the only place in Bolivia where you will find **very tall buildings** (10+ storeys).\n- In many parts of La Paz, you can see these heavily eroded, **pillar-like rock formations** on the hillsides. They consist of a very recognizable yellow-beige sandstone. Of the big cities with coverage in Bolivia, these rock formations are essentially unique to La Paz.\n- El Alto is situated on a very **flat, highland plateau**. It looks much drier and dustier than La Paz. The layout of its streets is also more regular and grid-like. The city appears like an unending mess of semi-finished red brick buildings, even more so than other cities in Bolivia. Some neighbourhoods have a very rundown, desolate look.\n- This type of pavement, consisting of rectangular **grey bricks **with slightly wavy edges, is very common in El Alto.\n- In El Alto, you can sometimes see a local type of architecture referred to as **Neo-Andean**. Buildings in this style are colourful, with elaborate, futuristic-looking façades. The style is really unique and is almost completely limited to El Alto.\n- Gates and doors in El Alto are sometimes painted with a **gradient pattern**, usually dark green to light green, or red to yellow.\n- Cochabamba is situated in a large flat valley, where you will almost always see an imposing wall of** mountains to your north**. This is the single most useful and consistent way of distinguishing this city from other places in Bolivia.\n- Of all the major cities in Bolivia, Oruro is situated in by far the most **dry landscape**. In Oruro, you will also usually be able to see a large **dry hill to your west**, in an otherwise mostly flat and very arid landscape. NOTE: Potosí is also located in an arid landscape. However, it is considerably hillier.\n- Sucre is situated in a very hilly landscape, and as a result you can see many elevation changes in its streets. Uniquely, you can see these **round, tree-covered hills **in many parts of the city.\n- Sucre has a well-preserved **historic city centre**, with lots of old colonial buildings. The downtown area can be recognized by the white walls, orange tiled roofs, and generally more historic look than other places in Bolivia.\n- Potosí is also situated in a very **hilly** landscape, like Sucre. However, its landscape is much more **arid**, with little to no trees atop the hills.\n- In many parts of Potosí, you can see this colossal pyramid-shaped mountain called **Cerro Rico**. It is famous for having massive quantities of silver ore, and as a result its surface is stripped bare by extensive mining – which is distinctly visible in the street view coverage.\n- Santa Cruz is the only large Bolivian city located in a **tropical** (and flat) landscape. Note that there are several smaller towns around Santa Cruz that look essentially identical. Some of these have extensive side-road coverage too.\n- Ruta 1 west of El Alto is a paved road that runs through green grasslands. The road itself is mostly flat, but you will usually see hills nearby. On the road, you will often see **numbers marked in white paint**. Near the western end of the road, close to Desaguadero and the border with Peru, you will be able to see Lake Titicaca to your north. NOTE: This road can look very similar to Ruta 2 northwest of El Alto. Road angles can help if you are not sure.\n- The section of Ruta 3 around Pongo, northeast of La Paz, can easily be recognised by the breathtaking views of **enormous mountains**, which are often surrounded by low-hanging clouds. The mountains are also recognizable by their dark grey rocks lightly covered in greenish grass.\n- The N Yungas Road (also popularly known as **Death Road**), is a bendy, small and unpaved road, high up in the mountains east of La Paz. The vegetation is very tropical. The coverage in the southern part of the road is very foggy. True to its unofficial name, this road looks like a very dangerous drive. You can sometimes see some daring cyclists. NOTE: The northern half of this road looks less foggy and dangerous. However, it should still be recognizable, as it is the only dirt road meandering through jungle hills in Bolivia.\n- Ruta 1 and 4 between La Paz and Oruro is a large **divided highway** that runs through the Altiplano landscape of western Bolivia. It is the only large, divided highway in the entire country. There are smaller, divided roads in and near some urban areas, but those should be easily distinguishable based on landscape and road size.\n- A long section of Ruta 4 has a distinctive **square smudge** on the front left of the camera. This coverage starts in the altiplano near Vila Vila, going east through Cochabamba, all the way to Buena Vista in the flat Amazonian part of Bolivia.\n- Around Morochata, northwest of Cochabamba on Ruta 25, there is a small isolated piece of coverage that looks **extremely similar to Peru**. It is a dirt road that meanders through a mountainous landscape. Knowing this road can be extremely helpful for country streak purposes. The western part of this road is located in a green mountain landscape, with fields on the mountain slopes and lots of eucalyptus trees around. Towards the east, it transitions into a more arid high altitude landscape that still looks very similar to Peru.\n- Ruta 1 between Machacamarca and Guindal runs through an arid landscape where you will often see patches of **snow on the hilltops**, and sometimes even next to the road. Weather conditions range from **cloudy to fully overcast**, lending this coverage a gloomy look. The aforementioned road can be regionguessed even more precisely. See the next two tips.\n- The section north of Challapata runs in a general **NNW direction**, with straight roads in flat terrain, with hills on one or both sides. Weather conditions are a little bit better, with some of the sky visible, especially when looking south.\n- The section southeast of Challapata tends to be more **curvy and hilly**. The weather is much worse, with grey skies.\n- The section of Ruta 7 between Mairana and the outskirts of Santa Cruz has coverage with a camera bug that causes a **visual glitch**. It is a distinctive, neon-like discoloration, that (depending on the road angle) is usually more or less to your north. NOTE: This glitch can also rarely be found in some limited areas in and around Santa Cruz. In these areas, the glitch is often not as severe.\n- The roads around the town of Mataral have recognizable coverage: a **very green, hilly** landscape, and **sunny weather** with only a couple of clouds. While the hills are very green, the vegetation is not very dense, and quite low. This coverage is limited to Ruta 7 from Comarapa to Mairana, and Ruta 22 to Vallegrande. Other roads in Bolivia with similar vegetation tend to either have different weather (overcast) or terrain (more flat).\n- In the aforementioned Mataral area, you will often see large **cacti** hiding between the bushes, as well as **trees with yellow flowers**.\n- The **eastern section of Ruta 4**, east of Santa Cruz, runs in a general east-west direction, through a mostly flat, green landscape. In some places, you can see some low hills. This road has both asphalt and concrete pad sections.\n- The section of Ruta 5 around Chaco, just north of Sucre, has distinct **sunset coverage**. Most of this road has concrete pavement, and meanders through semi-arid hills.\n- The section of Ruta 4, southwest of Patacamaya, runs through a semi-arid grassland landscape. Many parts of that road between Patacamaya and Callapa have **worn-down grainy asphalt**.\n- On the southwesternmost section of Ruta 4, you can usually see the **Nevado Sajama**, an isolated snow-capped volcano that is very distinct and unlike any other mountain in Bolivia. When you see Sajama, you will always be south of Callapa and the Desaguadero River. However, you will not always be able to see it on this section of the road, as it is often hidden by hills. NOTE: The only other place where you can see Nevado Sajama is coverage in the National Park, which is recognizable by its unique Google car.\n- The section of Ruta 6 between Tarabuco and Zudáñez is paved with **extremely light-coloured concrete**, bordering on white. This pavement is very recognizable and unique to this road.\n- Between the villages of Villa Vitalina and Coipasa, there is an isolated stretch of coverage where the Google car drove through **extremely arid** desert terrain. This small road is located close to the southwestern end of Ruta 12, near the Chilean border. It can be hard to spot on the map, because it blends in with the salt flat. Closer to Villa Vitalina, the car drove over the salt flat. Closer to Coipasa, the car drove on an unpaved dirt road, where you can see cone-shaped volcanic hills. In both parts, there is virtually no vegetation.\n- **Sajama National Park** was covered by this unique Google car: it has a black roof rack with a series of metal bars. The coverage is on an unpaved road surrounded by fluffy bushes. The Nevado Sajama volcano is always visible. The car briefly drove through the small village of Tomarapi, which can be recognized by its traditional buildings with adobe walls and thatched roofs."

                "description": "- All of Botswana was covered by a **white** Google car without an antenna. NOTE: Within Africa, this car can also be found in South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini.\n- Botswana has **white** front plates and **yellow** rear plates, similar to UK-style plates. NOTE: Botswana and Namibia are the only countries in southern Africa where yellow rear plates are predominantly found.\n- Signs in Botswana are usually in **English**. Most town names, however, are derived from any of the indigenous languages spoken in the country. NOTE: The Afrikaans language, which is closely related to Dutch and common in South Africa, is very rare in Botswana. You will almost never find Afrikaans place names.\n- The typical Botswana landscape is **dry and mostly flat**, though a limited amount of elevation can be found in certain regions. Common vegetation includes shrubs, small trees, and occasionally dry, golden grasslands. The soil is arid, sandy and ranges in colour from white to red. NOTE: The border region of South Africa can have a similar landscape.\n- Like the other countries in Southern Africa, outside road lines (if present) are **yellow**, while centre road lines are **white**. NOTE: Outside yellow road lines in arid environments also exist in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, and the UAE. However, these countries all drive on the right side.\n- Botswana has a unique **black-and-yellow striped signpost**. More rarely, you can see red-and-white signposts. NOTE: In Southern Africa, these signposts are only found in Botswana.\n- Curbs and guardrails are usually **striped**. Possible colour schemes are black-and-yellow, red-and-white, and black-and-white.\n- These small **red-and-white chevrons** can sometimes be found next to the road. NOTE: They are also very common in South Africa.\n- Just like the other Southern African countries, direction signs have a **green background**. The numbers of major roads start with **A**. These road numbers frequently appear on direction signs. NOTE: Road numbers in South Africa never start with A.\n- Some road signs have a **blue background**. This is an older style of sign that was used before signs with white backgrounds were introduced. They are relatively unique to Botswana. Note that most road signs will have the newer white background.\n- Typical Botswana houses range from small impoverished shacks to comfortable middle-class bungalows. Some buildings have exposed grey bricks. On occasion, you might find traditional round huts. NOTE: All of these house styles are also found in the other southern African countries.\n- **Random small blurs** are common in Botswana’s coverage. These blurs are similar to the ones found on licence plates and faces, but they cover seemingly random parts of the panorama instead. This is especially noticeable in urban areas, and mostly absent on more rural roads."

                "description": "- Botswana has many unique and distinct regions throughout the country. This image breaks down the main factors that differentiate each distinctive landscape by soil, vegetation and other clues. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._ RESOURCE: This image was made possible by the invaluable research done by Jasper Woodard. You can check out his Botswana videos on his YouTube channel.\n- Coverage in Botswana is fairly limited due to the country’s sparse road system. In addition to regular paved roads, you can still expect to see some rural unpaved road coverage. The most dense coverage is in the east and near Gaborone. The larger towns have extensive side road coverage.\n- This map shows which covered roads are **paved**, and which ones are **unpaved**. It is slightly simplified for ease of reading. Small, unpaved side roads in and near towns are not shown.\n- Most of Botswana is as flat as a pancake. However, every now and then you will find some elevation. If you see hills, you are most likely in one of the two areas indicated on the minimap. NOTE: Even in the indicated areas, there are a lot of very flat areas, as many of Botswana’s hills are geographically isolated. Some lone hills may also appear far outside the indicated areas.\n- The southeastern region near Gaborone has many **semi-arid hills covered in short shrubs**. If you see a lot of these, you are likely to be in the area between Gaborone and Lobatse. NOTE: Similar hills can be found elsewhere in the country and across the border in South Africa. If you see a large quantity of them, and use other clues to rule out South Africa, you can be fairly certain that you are in southeastern Botswana.\n- The landscape in the eastern pocket north of Francistown is characterised by **red soil **and a somewhat arid look. The soil in these two areas often looks firm and rocky, rather than sandy or dusty. Trees and bushes with yellowed leaves and other “**autumn**” colours are common. Many trees are bare and withered. You might see fallen leaves on the ground here and there.\n- A large region in the middle western part of the country is characterised by very **white **sandy soil. In addition, the vegetation tends to look **very dry**. NOTE: Sandy soil can be found in many places in Botswana. This tip specifically refers to the bright white colour of the sand.\n- The A35 is a very recognisable road: there is always a **power line to your west**. It can also be recognised by its grainy asphalt with faded markings. Many small tracks can be found parallel to the road, disappearing into the bushes.\n- The A33 is characterised by a landscape that is more **lush** than usual. Trees have lots of green leaves and the grass is very tall. The more north you go, the more lush the vegetation becomes.\n- The road that runs along Botswana’s southern border, through the town of Middlepits, has asphalt with a distinct **red tint**. The landscape is arid. In some sections, slight hills can be seen. NOTE: Near the town of Middlepits itself, the soil is very red and dotted with small white pebbles.\n- Gaborone is the capital and largest city. It tends to look **richer and more developed** than the rest of Botswana, though some neighbourhoods may still look impoverished. In some southern parts of the city hills can be seen, but most of the town is flat. NOTE: The only other place in the country that often looks similar is Francistown.\n- In Francistown, you can often see a** lone hill with radio antennas**, which is located on the north side of the city. This hill is a good way to distinguish Francistown from Gaborone. NOTE: The town of Serowe has a similar hill with antennas. Here, the towers are taller, red-and-white striped, and the hill has a flat top.\n- Maun is the only relatively large city in Botswana that has this bright **white sandy soil**, which is typical for the middle western region of the country."

                "description": "- The western part of the A2 has **overcast coverage**, making it recognisable.\n- Chobe Flood Plains National Park in the far north has a lot of **small, winding dirt road **coverage, with a lot of it being just south of the Chobe River. It has scattered lush bushes on either side, and you will often find wildlife such as elephants and warthogs.\n- This portion of the A30 has a distinct **autumn** feel unique to it. Notably, there are trees with orange coloured leaves lining the road in straight rows. In addition, there is often tall grass as opposed to other autumn looking locations.\n- **Salt pans** can be found in central-eastern Botswana. Dirt road coverage can be found leading to the pans and has similar soil and grass, but you can also find many trees along the road. They are mainly found around the Nwetwe pan. The salt pans show up as lakes on the map. NOTE: A lot of the dirt road coverage near the pans was taken in June, and will feature trees without leaves or those that are beginning to lose their leaves.\n- Just outside Gaborone, there is a lot of coverage along very rural, **small dirt tracks**. They can be identified by the orange-red shade of dirt and abundance of green trees and bushes surrounding the road.\n- The section of the A33 within the Sibuya Forest Reserve and the CT/3 (Tamafupa) Commercial Wildlife Utilisation is **under construction**. This is most visible by the service road or embankment alongside the road. NOTE: Despite being in the construction zone, some locations may still look normal.\n- The mostly unpaved road north of Maun to Khwai can be identified by **extremely white sandy soil and tall green trees** surrounding the road. The first section of the road, between Maun and Shorobe, is paved. But that section can still be identified by the trees, faint road markings, and power lines to the west of the road.\n- The A20 has mostly **clean, recent asphalt**. Some sections of the road are much **thinner** than usual. The landscape is characterised by red soil, dry grey-coloured trees, and very little grass.\n- Southeast of Tshabong, the A20 has been recently repainted and has very **bright yellow lines** and relatively **dark asphalt**. There is a powerline running alongside it to the northeast, it has orange-tan sandy soil, and you can often find patches of yellow flowers.\n- The Tsodilo Hills World Heritage Site is memorable due to its **large protruding hills** with exposed rock faces. The coverage around the hills is entirely on dirt roads.\n- These distinctive **silos** are found in Pandamatenga in northeastern Botswana and can be seen all around the town."

                "description": "- Licence plates in Brazil were **white **until 2018. Now, a **white plate with a blue stripe** on top is used. Red is still used for commercial vehicles.\n- **Portuguese **is spoken in Brazil, as opposed to most Latin American countries which speak Spanish. Compared to Spanish, some essential differences are that Portuguese uses -ão rather than -ón, -ch instead of -ll and -nh instead of -ñ.\n- Soil in most of Brazil is distinctly **red**. It can range from a light pink around Mato Grosso to a deep maroon near the Paraná river. The soil is usually not red in the North East, or in the majority of Rio Grande do Sul, however. NOTE: Parts of Paraguay and the nearby Argentine province of Misiones have deep red soil, as well a handful of other regions around the world.\n- The most common poles in Brazil have some resemblance to a **ladder **in the bottom portion. They are rectangular, have long segments running through the bottom, and small holes near the top. NOTE: Paraguay uses similar poles.\n- Most Brazilian road signs have the backs painted **black**. NOTE: This is also common in Paraguay.\n- **Blue road markers** with the road number and kilometre can be seen on the sides of roads.\n- Brazil uses **yellow **on **black **chevrons, as opposed to most of South America, which use black on yellow chevrons.\n- Roads in Brazil will usually feature **double yellow** middle lines, with white outer lines. Roads can occasionally have a single dashed yellow line.\n- There are frequently **white painted kerbs** on Brazilian roads.\n- Many houses throughout Brazil have **orange tiled roofs**.\n- It is fairly common to see **transparent satellite dishes**, which within Latin America is generally unique to Brazil.\n- **Blue Fortlev water tanks **are often seen on Brazilian roofs.\n- In Generation 3 coverage, you can see two different cars: - A white car with a **stubby antenna**. There is a diagonal coil wrapped around the antenna. - A white car with **no antenna**. The car’s colour is not always visible, meaning you will often see either just the stubby antenna, or no hints of the car at all. The stubby antenna with a diagonal coil can also be found in Ecuador, Colombia, and Mexico.\n- The Generation 4 cars you can find in Brazil have a visible front, and have one of the following three colour patterns: - **Blue** - **White with a blue stripe** - **White**\n- Brazil also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. NOTE: Brazil, Peru and Argentina are the only South American countries with smallcam."

                "description": "- Most of the coverage in Brazil is along the **eastern **half, with only sparse coverage in the Amazon. It is useful for beginning players to start forming a rough mental map of where the (limited) coverage is in the western half. When you get Amazonian rounds, this can prevent you from wildly plonking hundreds of kilometres away from the nearest road.\n- **Area codes** are common to see in Brazil. They are often notated using parentheses, or at minimum as two separate numbers. Phone numbers are sometimes without area codes, and without them will be 8 numbers long for landline and 9 for mobile. The pattern for each of the states is very learnable and useful. The area codes are grouped by first digit, so even just learning those can already help a lot. Notably, area codes ending in 1 will always be around major cities and state capitals.\n- Each Brazilian state has a **two-letter acronym**. These show up most prominently in the numbers of state roads (found on kilometre markers). They can also be found in other contexts however. The state acronyms show up when you zoom out a little bit on Google maps, which is also possible in the minimap while in-game. However, for quick and or competitive games, it can be very useful to learn them by heart anyway, as this can help a lot with eliminating scanning time.\n- **Postcodes (CEP) **are seen frequently on street signs in Brazil (though sometimes hard to read). The first two numbers will depict an area, a state or multiple states. The numbers go anti-clockwise from São Paulo, ending in Rio Grande do Sul.\n- Shown here is an **elevation map** of Brazil. It can help to have a rough mental map of where you can find mountains, and which regions are more flat. The highest mountains are generally found near the southeastern coast.\n- Northeastern Brazil can be identified by its **dry soil, shrubs and succulents** (the Caatinga landscape). In rainy season coverage, the shrubs are still recognisable, but can be deceptively green.\n- The **Amazon** is a dense rainforest that comprises 40% of Brazil’s total area. Not many roads are within it, but those that are, mostly go through either biodiverse forest or grassy hills with sparse trees.\n- Acre has a unique landscape of **small grass hills** and sparsely growing trees. The roads often do not cut around the hills like in most of Brazil, but ride the hills instead. A similar landscape can also be seen near Maraba in the state of Pará.\n- Rural locations in Roraima are mostly open **grassy plains with large, distant mountains** in the background. Occasionally, you are on roads within the mountains. Furthermore, the grass in Roraima is distinctly thin, and grows in bunches.\n- The landscape in Rio Grande do Sul can be hilly or flat with lush, green fields. Southern areas can have some resemblance to Uruguay.\n- Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo often have **rolling grassy hills**.\n- Espírito Santo, and the surrounding areas, often have large mountains with **exposed rock**.\n- These distinct trees, called **Paraná pines**, have long horizontal branches with leaves only at the end. They grow mainly in the southern Brazilian states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul.\n- Coconut palm trees have long leaves, **can grow very tall, and have thin trunks**. They are common across the north eastern states and sometimes further west or south along the coast. NOTE: Coconut palms grow across the world and are not unique to Brazil.\n- Carnaúba palms have short but strong, **fan-like leaves** and a trunk that is smooth at the top and spiked at the bottom. They are common in Ceará but are also in Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte.\n- Babassu palms have long, robust leaves comprised of many leaflets. Trunk length can vary from short to tall. They are found throughout the Amazon, or more rarely, down the east coast.\n- Açai palms produce fruits that are popular globally. Most of these palms are found near Belem, but can be seen across the Amazon. They are distinct in the way the **leaflets droop downward** along with their unusually thin trunks.\n- Moriche palms have leaves with a **rounded fan shape**. They are most common in Amazonas, Acre, and Roraima, but can be found in all of the Amazonian states. NOTE: These palms can additionally be found very commonly in the Amazonian parts of Colombia and Peru.\n- Macaw palms have **thin leaves** compared to other palms, and often have a visible **spear shaped** top. They are very common around Mato Grosso do Sul and the surrounding states, but can be seen much further out sometimes. These palms should be used with caution, and single trees are much less of an indicator than multiple trees.\n- This species of plant, with **long stems** and many leaves growing up, are very common in Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, and Paraíba. In the dry season, you can still make out the distinct long stems without leaves.\n- **Very tall grass** can be often seen in the centre of the country, most notably in the Tocantins, Goiás, Bahia, and Minas Gerais states.\n- **Eucalyptus Grandis**, when fully grown, is a very tall tree with plantations all over Brazil. You can find them in both large and very small plantations., as well as randomly growing anywhere. You can see them all over the south, but there are some large plantations in Amapá too.\n- **Sugarcane plantations** are by far most common in the state of São Paulo, and in the coastal north east states, especially Alagoas and Pernambuco.\n- **Soybeans** appear as small, leafy soil grown plants. They are most commonly grown in Mato Grosso, Paraná, and Goiás.\n- **Coffee beans** are by far the most common in Minas Gerais, but also can be found in Espírito Santo and northeastern São Paulo.\n- Alongside ladder poles, **round poles** can often be found across the south of Brazil, especially São Paulo. These poles are cylindrical and made of concrete. NOTE: This map and the following wooden pole map was created using statistical analysis of semi-urban and rural locations. 434 locations of 3 poles per location were used across 16 states that were thought to have mixed poles. Regardless of the state, the centre of large cities will often have round poles.\n- Some states also use **wooden poles**. They are most commonly seen in Rio Grande do Sul, Roraima, Amazonas, and Rio de Janeiro.\n- Brazil often uses **supports **on its electricity poles that connect the crossbar to the stem of the pole. The frequency of pole supports varies greatly state-to-state. It is notably rare in the northeast. NOTE: This tip only works for poles that have a crossbar.\n- Markings on poles are used by the electricity companies to identify them. This pole ID is **long**, **yellow** **pole paint **with a black code. The ones that start with a letter are found in Bahia and Pernambuco.\n- Similar to the Bahia and Pernambuco poles, Goiás poles also use **long, yellow pole paint **with a black paint code, but it always starts with a number. They also have a rarer yellow on black pole ID, which can be either paint or a plate.\n- This **small yellow or orange plate** attached onto the pole by thin metal or zip tie is found in Rio Grande do Norte and Pernambuco. This ID is usually much higher up the pole in Pernambuco than in Rio Grande do Norte.\n- Pole IDs in Paraná are usually made up of **black paint** and yellow or white painted text.\n- Most poles in Maranhão have a **small beige plate with numbers** built into the surface of the pole. This pole ID can be found in Pará and Piauí more rarely.\n- Utility poles in Paraná on intersections are sometimes **painted with the street name**. This can sometimes extend to Santa Catarina or Rio Grande do Sul if there are ladder poles in the city.\n- This poletop, consisting of an **asymmetrical crossbar** and a **support** reaching to the middle of the longer** **part of the crossbar, is the most common poletop in the state of São Paulo. It can also be frequently seen in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and Mato Grosso do Sul.\n- This **asymmetrical** **crossbar** with **no supports** is exclusive to Ceara and Rondonia. NOTE: While the crossbar in Ceara is usually made of concrete, the Rondonian variation features a metal crossbar, and is far less common.\n- This pole configuration, featuring a zigzag-shaped top bar resting atop a flat crossbar, is exclusive to Ceara and Roraima. The pole is usually much larger than a regular electricity pole.\n- Poles that have a smooth cone on top, often called a **pencil pole**,** **are common in the state of Rio de Janeiro and rarely in Brasília and Manaus.\n- **Gamma-shaped**** poles** containing **electricity boxes** at the end of the bar are most commonly seen in the state of Rio de Janeiro and in the cities of Belém, Salvador, Fortaleza and Maceió. NOTE: A variation with a shorter bar is exclusive to Belém.\n- You may frequently see** electricity counters** attached to the poles in Cuiabá, Macapá and large cities in the state of Pará. NOTE: The electricity counter may consist of one or several compartments.\n- Poles that have one insulator on top and **alternating** horizontal insulators can be found in Mato Grosso and southern Acre. It is also very rare in Rio Grande do Sul.\n- Insulators that resemble **brown mushrooms** are only found in Pernambuco.\n- Insulators that resemble **white mushrooms** are found in Bahia and rarely Brasília.\n- **Transparent** insulators are mostly in Alagoas in the northeast, and Santa Catarina in the south. They can be seen rarely in Sergipe, Ceará, and Brasília.\n- These insulators have a shape resembling a **spool of thread**. They are found mostly in Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo, and have been seen in Ceará.\n- Insulators in Ceará can sometimes be uniquely **long and thin**. They are in Goiás too, but are rare.\n- Poles with **horizontal insulators** are very common in Pará and less so in Mato Grosso. They are rarely found in Acre, Amapá, Tocantins, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.\n- **Long grey insulators**, not including when they are horizontal, are most commonly found in Pará, Mato Grosso, Tocantins, Bahia, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Santa Catarina. They are found rarely in Maranhão, Rio Grande do Norte, Alagoas, Sergipe, Rondônia, and Rio Grande do Sul. Other states have between 0 and 5%.\n- Poles with these **black double UFO-shaped insulators in a trident formation** are common in Maranhão. The insulator itself is common across many states, but not in this configuration.\n- These insulators are spherical or cone shaped and suspended on a rod above the insulator bar. They are often referred to as **“lollipop” insulators**. They are very common in Rio Grande de Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, and more rarely, Sergipe.\n- These **dark brown insulators** with grey bases are found almost exclusively in Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul.\n- Brazil often uses metal trash baskets outside houses. In Acre and Rondônia, however, it is much more common to see them made of **concrete**.\n- Lamps in Minas Gerais and Goias will often feature **two parts** to them. They can also be found in** **Rio Grande do Norte, Ceará, Rio Grande do Sul as well as the Federal District.\n- Lamps in urban northern Paraná sometimes have **no lamp arm**. Styles contrast, and are either colourful, plastic and industrial, or look fancy and ornate. Both versions are most commonly found in northwest Paraná.\n- The vast majority of poles in Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Pará, Amapá, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco and Santa Catarina have the **lamp arm attached** to the pole, as opposed to it being attached with a plate, which is much more common generally.\n- Lamps in Roraima have a **similar style** but have **different colours** in the main cities. Boa Vista, Normandia, and Mucajaí have red lamps, Rorainópolis has blue lamps, Pacaraima and Iracema have green, and Caracaraí has yellow.\n- Lamps in Ceará often have a **fancy and colourful arm**, whether as lampposts or attached to utility poles. It sometimes says the town on the arm.\n- São Paulo has far more **divided highways** than any other state.\n- **Phone numbers** can sometimes be seen underneath kilometre markers in São Paulo.\n- **Cobblestone pavement** is most common in the northeast and in Rio Grande do Sul.\n- Roads with **hexagonal** concrete tiles can be found across Brazil, but they are more common in Santa Catarina and Minas Gerais.\n- Some roads in Acre are made of **red brick**.\n- Cobblestone roads with **randomly sized stones** are most common in southeast Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais.\n- These **uneven** but mostly **square** stone roads are seen in western Rio Grande do Sul and west Santa Catarina. The soil will often be very dark in these regions too. NOTE: The same roads are seen in the Misiones province of Argentina.\n- You can often see pavements in Rio Grande do Sul that have **brown tiles** but are either jagged and random, or square. This style can sometimes be seen in Santa Catarina.\n- Buildings in the southern states, mainly Santa Catarina, can be of **European influence** (typically vaguely German) in design and style.\n- Wooden houses on stilts are very common in the state of Acre. NOTE: They are also seen more rarely in low-lying Amazonas and Pará, as well as various other countries.\n- Most roads in Piauí have **red gravel** on the side of the road. Some roads in Generation 4 now have tarmac and kerbs, but some gravel shoulders remain.\n- In all Generation 4 coverage in Amapá, the front right of the camera is **smudged**. In addition, all Generation 4 coverage in Amapá features the white car with the blue stripe.\n- You can often see **rifts** in Alagoas Generation 3 coverage.\n- These spheres on top of utility poles are **João-de-Barro nests**. They are common across the south of Brazil."

It is dry, with large mountains containing numerous “folds.”\n- Coastal regions in Rio Grande do Sul are recognisable due to being a rare **flat wetland**, which is uncommon in Brazil.\n- São Paulo has a **square, yellow** pole ID paint. It has three letters on top followed by two numbers, a black line, and four more numbers. The three letters represent the municipality within São Paulo, but are rarely visible.\n- Street signs in Campo Grande and Joinville are **stickers** wrapped around a pole at intersections. Campo Grande signs usually have extra information and a red and yellow stripe.\n- Lamps in Rio de Janeiro are **curved** through the whole of the lamp arm, which is not seen anywhere else.\n- Teresina lamps are usually **blue** with an **orange arm**.\n- Belém lamp heads are often **orange**.\n- Cuiaba lamps are usually a **light green**, and is one of the few cities that has poles with multiple electricity metres, sometimes 6 to 12.\n- Lamps in Belo Horizonte and Uberaba in Generation 4 can have a **white, numbered plaque** attached to the lamp.

Since this plaque is new, it may appear in other cities in Minas Gerais in the future.\n- Lamps in Caxias do Sul usually have a **zig-zag** bent pole and a yellow head.\n- Poles on Santa Catarina Island (Florianópolis) are painted **white** with **blue and red stripes**.\n- Northwest Rio Grande do Sul has coverage with this **camera glitch** in Generation 3.\n- The 364 through Acre is very recognisable due to the **rollercoaster-like landscape and road**: the road uniquely rides the hills rather than snaking around them. There is usually no traffic, and is covered mostly by Generation 3 with an antenna.\n- The Amazonas 319 has a very lush, bright green and tropical landscape, as it **cuts through the Amazon rainforest**. The road is flat and mostly unpaved, featuring bright orange soil. However, closer to Manaus the road becomes paved. There are wooden or ladder poles alongside the entire stretch. It is covered by the blue Generation 4 car.\n- The Pará section of the 163 is often **hilly, curvy, dry, and sometimes hazy**. It has a wide range of amazonian vegetation. The road is frequently trafficked, usually by transportation trucks. It is covered by the blue Generation 4 car.\n- This **Amazonian trekker** combines boat and walking coverage on and near the Madeira and Aripuana rivers, south of the 319. They are seen travelling through dense rainforest and small villages.\n- The beautiful National Park of Northeast Maranhão, known for its **sand dunes** with pools of water, has walking trekker and vehicle coverage. The truck is white with a black bed. The landscape can vary from beach to sandy wetland.\n- Ilha de Fernando de Noronha is a **Brazilian island** with official coverage approximately 340 kilometres northeast of Rio Grande do Norte, and the country itself. It is covered by a white buggy, which is visible at the front. The island is similar in vegetation to the closest part of mainland Brazil, and has large exposed rocks. There is also boat coverage around the island."

Beware that none of the coverage is considered pinpointable, and as a result you are unlikely to get it in most community-made maps. As such, this guide is mainly intended to give a general idea of what type of coverage you can find on the islands.\n- Coverage was taken with a Generation 3 **trekker**.\n- Coverage is mostly found on small atolls in the northern half of the territory.\n- A large portion of the coverage is taken on sand beaches. You will typically see many palm trees along the beaches.\n- Coastal palm forests also comprise a significant portion of the coverage. They almost exclusively consist of coconut palms.\n- Mangroves can be found on several of the atolls.\n- Some of the larger islands with coverage have grassy fields surrounded by bushes and palms.\n- The trekker can occasionally be found walking offshore in the water."

                "description": "- Bulgarian licence plates have the typical European design, with the blue strip on the left.\n- Bulgaria mainly uses the **Cyrillic alphabet**. However, a lot of signs will also have the Latin alphabet. The letter “Ъ” is only found in Bulgarian and Russian, although it is fairly uncommon in Russian.\n- The Bulgarian word for street is **улица** (ulitsa), sometimes abbreviated **ул.** (ul.). NOTE: In older street signs seeing only Cyrillic is more common. Russia also uses улица/ulitsa.\n- There are three types of Generation 4 cars that were used to cover Bulgaria: - A **blue** car, which can be found in most European countries. - A **red** car, which is also found in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Slovakia, and Sweden. Of these, Russia and Slovakia are easiest to confuse with Bulgaria. - A **black** car, which is found in many European countries; of which Greece and Croatia are the ones more likely to be confused with Bulgaria. All cars can be found with or without antenna. Additionally, you can also encounter coverage where the car is completely hidden.\n- The majority of Generation 3 coverage in Bulgaria was taken during March and April, resulting in very distinct dead-looking “winter” coverage. NOTE: Hungary and Czechia also have a lot of similar dead-looking Generation 3 coverage. Furthermore, while not common, Bulgaria has some summer Generation 3.\n- You can commonly see a small piece of **grey tape **at the top of the car antenna in Generation 3 coverage. The community sometimes refers to it as “flag antenna”. Not all Gen 3 coverage has this tape. NOTE: This can also be seen in Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, and Romania.\n- Most utility poles in Bulgaria are **cylindrical **and made of **concrete**. There is also a less common concrete ‘ladder pole’ variation. You can also sometimes see simple wooden poles.\n- Most poles have small, alternating **hook-shaped** insulators.\n- This style of pole top, with 3 large, alternating insulators that are shaped like **upward facing hooks**, is a good clue for Bulgaria. This pole top is probably unique to the country. NOTE: You can also find this pole top with the insulators facing downwards.\n- Bulgarian chevrons are typically **red on white**. NOTE: Many other European countries have similar chevrons. Crucially, among neighbouring countries, Romania, Turkey, and North Macedonia use the same chevrons. Greece and Serbia use black and white chevrons however. See this infographic for an overview.\n- Bulgarian directional signs are blue, arrow-shaped, and use both the **Cyrillic and Latin** alphabet. Importantly, even if you are far away and cannot decipher the script, you can still see that the sign has two lines of text instead of one.\n- Town entry signs have a simple white design and also use both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabet. Like with the directional signs, the two lines of text are obvious, even when seen from far away.\n- Bulgarian pedestrian signs have **four stripes**, and the person is wearing a hat. NOTE: No other eastern or central European pedestrian signs have four stripes.\n- Bollards are generally **fairly rare** in Bulgaria. When you see them, they almost always have this somewhat generic design, which is relatively similar to the bollards found in Croatia and Hungary. They have a red reflector on the front, and a white one on the back. The design isn’t terribly consistent: sometimes they are thinner, and the shape of the reflector varies.\n- Bulgaria usually has **thin** roadlines. This is particularly useful to tell Bulgaria apart from Romania, where roadlines are usually much thicker.\n- Bulgaria generally has fairly **poor-quality roads**, with many small cracks and occasionally potholes.\n- Most houses in Bulgaria have orange tiled roofs, with distinct **patches of ****mortar**) along the corner tiles. Famously, Bulgarian roofs often seem **poorly constructed**: the roof tiles and mortar tend to be uneven, especially when compared to other European countries.\n- Suburbs in Bulgaria are generally among the **poorest areas** in Europe, with small, densely built houses and generally an almost ghetto-like look.\n- Metallic trash bins with this shape are very common in Bulgaria. NOTE: This style of bin is also common in Turkey and other balkan countries such as Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia."

                "description": "- The Balkan mountains cut across Bulgaria and divide the country in two distinct halves. North of them, you will find a mostly flat area that goes all the way to the border with Romania. The Rhodope Mountains start close to Sofia and run South-East into Greece. In them you will find the highest peaks of Bulgaria. Between both mountain ranges you will find the second biggest flat area of Bulgaria. The westernmost part of the country usually features many small valleys surrounded by hills and small mountains.\n- Area codes in Bulgaria are one of the best clues to regionguess urban rounds. Conveniently, they are ordered by first digit, so just learning the first digit can yield high results with little effort. Numbers between parentheses in the map are area codes from a neighbouring province that frequently spill into that one. Codes next to a small dot represent area codes unique to the province capital.\n- The towering mountains of Pirin and Rila National Parks can be recognised by the tall pyramid-shaped peaks, and can be seen from a few different vantage points in Blagoevgrad, Kyustendil and Sofia Provinces.\n- Wind turbines are most common in Dobrich Province, and usually towards the coast.\n- Buildings with features similar to Alpine architecture, such as **white walls** with **brown wooden details** are commonly found in and around the Smoljan region in the south.\n- Locations with an invisible Generation 4 Street View car can be found along the North and West borders of Bulgaria, as well as the northern half of the coast.\n- A **red** Generation 4 Street View car is mostly found in central and southeastern Bulgaria. This car can be found with and without an antenna.\n- Generation 3 coverage with a piece of **tape** on a **short antenna** can be commonly found in the eastern part of Bulgaria. NOTE: Tape antennas can very rarely appear in other provinces, the only provinces where it’s never found are Vratsa, Montana, Pazardzhik and Smolyan.\n- Generation 3 locations with a **taped long antenna **and visible white car can be found in Stara Zagora, and rarely a few small roads in Plovdiv and Burgas. NOTE: This combination of car and antenna can be found more commonly in other European countries as well. Make sure to use other clues.\n- This antenna with unpeeled tape at the top, resulting in a bulkier antenna tip, can be found in the Varna Province. Coverage with this antenna is exclusively in March, resulting in a dead winter look."

Most of the streets are paved with cobblestone.\n- White street signs with **two red strips**; one covering the bottom and one covering part of the top, can be found in Sofia.

Plates on government vehicles are green.\n- On the Generation 3 coverage you can find two different Google cars: - A car with a short, stubby antenna. The antenna has **three ridges**. It can sometimes be hard to tell if the antenna has ridges. - A white car with **stripes** and no antenna. There is a white stripe on the left, and a yellow stripe on the right. The stripes are sometimes poorly visible. The car is not always as visible as shown in the example images. NOTE: This specific striped white car is unique to Cambodia. Make sure not to mix it up with the Bangladeshi striped car, which looks slightly different. The Latin American countries of Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil also have cars with similar short antennas. However, these have a diagonally coiled ridge, instead of Cambodia’s three ridges.\n- Cambodia drives on the **right**. NOTE: Thailand drives on the left, while Laos also drives on the right.\n- **Khmer **is the official language of Cambodia. It has its own unique script, which is very distinct and recognizable. In most fonts, letters have an intricate, curvy look. Khmer can look fairly different depending on the font used. A compilation of what this script looks like in street view can be found here. NOTE: The Thai and Lao scripts look similar, but the letters tend to have a less intricate look. However, some simplified Khmer fonts can look a bit like Thai and Lao.\n- Two types of poles are common: - Concrete** ladder** poles (so named because the indents and ridges resemble a ladder). - Round concrete poles with small **holes**. Rarely, you might see simple wooden poles. NOTE: The same type of round concrete pole is also common in Vietnam. You can easily distinguish between Thailand and Cambodia based on the poles. Thailand uses square concrete poles with rows of small pinholes on the sides. Such poles are very uncommon in Cambodia (but not completely absent).\n- Cambodia has a variety of different **bollards**. The most common ones are: - A stone bollard with red-and-white stripes. - A stone bollard with a red top and a white base, usually with a reflector in the red part. Some bollards are unique to a road or region. More details can be found in the region-guessing section.\n- Cambodian** road markers** are made of stone, with a white-coloured base and a rounded red top. You will find the road number on the narrow side and a town name with a distance on the main side.\n- Chevrons in Cambodia are **black with yellow arrows**. Chevrons are somewhat rare. On many occasions, Cambodia prefers to use bollards instead of chevrons to mark curves in the road. NOTE: Chevrons in all other Southeast Asian countries have the reverse colour scheme: yellow with black arrows.\n- Roads have dashed or solid **yellow middle road lines**. Outer road lines are somewhat rare, but when present, they are solid white. NOTE: Thailand uses similar road lines.\n- Many roads are **unpaved**. Usually, only main roads and roads in and near urban areas are paved.\n- **Wooden houses on stilts** are common. Walls are often made of vertical planks. Many homes have double or triple roofs.\n- In addition, traditional Cambodian wooden stilt houses tend to have very recognizable **colour schemes**. - Walls are commonly painted dark red-brown, light blue or an ochre orange. - Doors, windows and other architectural details are often painted bright blue. NOTE: More modern houses tend to have a wider variety of colour schemes.\n- Many traditional homes have **tiled orange or red roofs**, sometimes with ornaments on the ridges and corners. Corrugated and plain metal roofs are also common. On other, more modern buildings, you can see a wider variety of roof colours and materials.\n- The majority of Cambodians are **Buddhist**. Temples are common throughout the country. Temple architecture is highly decorative, with ornamented roofs. You might also see Buddhist flags. NOTE: Thailand and Laos are also majority Buddhist. Temples in these countries can look similar.\n- You will see a lot of **advertisements** for the beer brands Angkor, Anchor, and the very creatively named Cambodia Beer.\n- Throughout the country, you can find distinct **blue signs** from the Cambodian People’s Party (CPP). These signs occasionally feature the likenesses of major party politicians: usually three men side by side.\n- Google used a weird, low-quality camera in Cambodia. This camera is known as the official Ari (or “Shitcam”). It has a wide circular car blur and often somewhat brownish colours. A good map will not usually include this coverage, but it is good to be aware of its existence, in order to not be caught off-guard by it. NOTE: Within Asia, India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also have shitcam coverage."

Most of the coverage is located around the cities of Phnom Penh, Siem Reap and Battambang. _You can click on the image to enlarge it. You can also view the official street view coverage in more detail on this site._\n- Shitcam in Cambodia is only found in the **southwestern** half.\n- The **low-lying central plain** is home to most agricultural land. The landscape is flat, cultivated, and dotted with villages and farms.\n- Conversely, **the northeast** is much more uncultivated: there is less agriculture and more natural vegetation. Some areas are slightly hilly.\n- **The southwest** is the area with the most elevation in Cambodia. This region is characterized by hills and low mountains. Some inland roads feature dense forest cover, but the coastal areas in particular are fairly densely populated.\n- **Sandy, white soil** is very common in the region southeast of Phnom Penh, as well as around the city itself. The colour can range from bright white to slightly beige. NOTE: You may find sandy, white soil in other parts of the country, however it is by far the most common in this area. Conversely, some roads in this region can have darker soil than expected.\n- Near the northern border with Thailand, you can often see a **mountainous ridgeline to your north**. The soil in this region tends to be red, ranging from a slight reddish tinge to deep dark red. The ridgeline closely corresponds with the border with Thailand. The drop-off to the Cambodian lowland to its south is abrupt. This means that the roads you are on are themselves located in a very flat landscape (see inset map).\n- **Rubber tree plantations** are found in three places: - In a narrow belt northeast of Phnom Penh, mostly centred around the southern sections of Roads 7 and 71 - Around the town of Ban Lung in the far northeast, as well as east of it on and near Road 78. - Around the town of Pech Sreada. This area has a distinct look. See the tip in the spotlight section. Rubber trees can be recognized by their thin trunks and dark green crowns. The trees are neatly arranged in rows. They often have small taps near the bottom of the trunk. NOTE: Rubber trees are common in Thailand. Only use this clue to region-guess if you are certain that you are in Cambodia, and not to identify the country."

NOTE: Make sure to check other clues before guessing, because this style of bollard is commonly found in Thailand.\n- The road between Road 48 and Kiri Sakor is under construction and only has **one paved road side**. The unpaved side has red soil.\n- Several **unpaved jungle offroads** in the southwest of the country, northeast of Road 48, have a distinct look: red soil, dense jungle, and generally hilly terrain. NOTE: Some rural jungle roads in the east of the country can look similar. Here, however, the soil tends to be more brownish or orange rather than red.\n- The coverage close to **Phnum Samkos** has a distinct look: overcast weather, and large, prominent mountains that are visible in the distance. The roads are unpaved and consist of brown soil. Wild, very green vegetation can be seen all around you.\n- Unique **triangular bollards** with red stripes can be found in three places in Cambodia, all located in the same area in the southwest: - On Road 4 between Angk Snuol and Preah Sihanouk. They are especially common in the section between Kirirom National Park and Preah Sihanouk. - One small off-road of Road 4, in Ream National Park near Preah Sihanouk. - In Preah Monivong National Park.\n- There is another good way to recognize Road 4 between Angk Snuol and Preah Sihanouk: in most sections, it has a distinctive **wide, red-brownish shoulder **on both sides of the road. NOTE: Near Phnom Penh, the soil of these shoulders tends to have a lighter, pinkish or beige colour. In the hills and closer to Preah Sihanouk, the soil tends to have a darker colour.\n- **Oil palm plantations** can only be found on Road 4, as well as some of its rural offroads, just north of Preah Nob. NOTE: Oil palm plantations are much more common in Malaysia and Indonesia. Only use this clue to region-guess if you are certain that you are in Cambodia, and not to identify the country.\n- **Preah Monivong National Park** in the south of the country has a unique and recognizable landscape. It is situated on a highland plateau. The soil is white and very rocky. The vegetation consists of stunted, windswept bushes and low trees. The foliage has a distinct dark green tint that contrasts with the white rocks. Some parts of the park are more forested but will still have the same rocky soil.\n- **Road 41**, southwest of Phnom Penh, has a recognizable look and road angle: - It is a wide road, with a grey and very gravelly road surface - It runs in a general NNE direction - The landscape close to the road is flat and agricultural. However, you can often see hills in the distance. NOTE: There are other roads that can look similar. Therefore, the road angle is very important to identify this road.\n- In the sections of Road 6 west of Siem Reap, to Sisophon, and Road 5, south of Sisophon to Krong Battambang, you can find power lines with **unique poles** that are found nowhere else in Cambodia. The pole tops have three horizontal beams, with hanging insulators** on only one side**. The bottom of the poles have indents.\n- The powerline from the previous tip continues on the section of Road 5 west of Sisophon. However, here the pole tops have insulators **on both sides**. The rest of the pole is identical however.\n- The **southern section of Road 76**, south of Krong Saen Monourom, has recognizable coverage: overcast weather, dark asphalt, the presence of outer road lines, and relatively crisp lines for Cambodian standards. Furthermore, a large part of the eastern half of this road runs through hilly terrain with dense jungle.\n- Most of the **northern section of Road 76**, between Lumphat and Mayura Wild Park, is recognizable too: it is a wide, unpaved road, with brown soil, and a semi-open jungle forest all around you. Weather conditions start off as overcast on the southern end of the road, and quickly improve the further north you go, with almost completely clear skies on the northern end. NOTE: There are other, smaller roads that can look similar. However, this road is by far the longest that has this distinct look.\n- Around the town of **Pech Sreada**, in the far east of Cambodia, you can find rubber tree plantations that were covered during the dry season, leading to a distinct look. In addition, the soil is very orange, making it easy to distinguish this area from other regions in Cambodia with rubber tree plantations.\n- **Angkor Wat** is a massive temple complex built by the historical Khmer Empire. It is located just north of Siem Reap and has extensive trekker coverage. It can be recognized by its dark, weathered stone buildings. While this location is unlikely to show up in competitive maps, it is extremely common in GeoGuessr’s official Cambodia map."

For example, speed is measured in **kilometres **per hour. NOTE: This is useful to distinguish between the US, where American English spelling and (usually) the imperial system are used. For example, the US measures speed in miles.\n- Canada has a fair amount of **Generation 2 coverage**, especially in rural** **or remote areas. Generation 2 can be recognized by the big circular car blur and the halo-like colour distortion in the sky. NOTE: Generation 2 is very rare in the US. If you are between Canada and the US, and the location is in Generation 2, you are much more likely to be in Canada.\n- **Generation 3** is significantly more common in Canada than in the US. In addition, the side mirrors are blurred out differently: While they generally appear as **two peaks** in Canadian Gen 3 coverage, you will mostly see a single peak in the US.\n- Canada also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. When the car isn’t blurred properly, you will usually see a mirror sticking out on the right side.\n- Canada uses unique **diamond**-shaped T-Intersection signs. Some provinces use different designs. You can learn more about those in the region guessing section. NOTE: Canada is the only country in the world where you can find these signs. The US, for example, uses rectangular** **T-Intersection signs.\n- Canada uses the word **‘maximum’ **on speed signs. Because speed is measured in kilometres instead of miles, the numbers tend to be higher than the US which can be identifiable from afar. NOTE: The US uses the words **‘speed limit’ **on such signs. In addition, speed limits ending with 5 are more common in the US, and the ‘speed limit’ text takes up two lines versus one for ‘maximum’ in Canada.\n- Canadian roads usually have **single yellow **centre lines. However, double middle yellow centre lines are still decently common. NOTE: Double yellow centre lines are more common in the US. This is not a 100% reliable clue, so make sure to use this along with other clues.\n- You can sometimes find **communal mailboxes** in Canada. Personal mailboxes are still very common, though. Canada Post has a **red logo**, which sometimes appears on mailboxes. NOTE: These communal mailboxes are very rare in the US. In addition, the US Postal Service has a blue logo.\n- Canadian road signs tend to be **less wordy** compared to their US counterparts. Good examples of this are railroad crossing and yield signs. In the US, these usually have the literal words ‘railroad crossing’ and ‘yield’ written on them, whereas in Canada, these signs are typically** **blank."

As well, all commercial vehicles in Newfoundland and Labrador are required to use front plates, and so it is possible to see them on vans and pickup trucks. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- French is the majority language in **Québec** and parts of **New Brunswick**. NOTE: At the federal level, French has official status alongside English, so you can sometimes find bilingual signs in other parts of Canada.

Ontario speed limit signs may have a **black section** on the bottom with the words ‘km/h’ or ‘begins’ written in white. British Columbian signs also include the ‘km/h’ but **lack **the black section. Québec can sometimes have **French **on their speed limit signs. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Alberta has a unique **black and white **bollard that is often found at intersections. It has a **cylindrical **shape and two black bands that wrap all the way around. It is one of the most useful Canadian bollards to learn because it appears so frequently. NOTE: Some Alberta bollards have a yellow band between the two black bands, instead of a white one. Blue bands can also rarely be seen, particularly in and around Calgary, while green bands are rarely seen in and around Edmonton.\n- Manitoba uses black and grey painted bollards. Most of the time an **orange stripe** will be present below the grey one. Wooden, rectangular bollards of this form are typically found further north in Manitoba. NOTE: Bollards in this format with just a black top are seen in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.\n- British Columbia has black-and-white bollards with a thin, slightly curved shape. It is most commonly found on Vancouver Island, but can be found all throughout the province. NOTE: They can look superficially similar to the Alberta bollard. However, the thin shape and the wider spacing of the two black bands should help you tell them apart.\n- Québec has unique bollards that are always attached to guardrails. They are long, thin white poles with a **red** or **green reflector** at the top.\n- You will often find these **yellow fire hydrant markers** atop signposts in Québec. In Québec City these markers will usually have a blue rectangle and markers in Trois-Rivières are distinctly small. NOTE: Sometimes the markers will have different colours. Beware that Edmundston, in New Brunswick, uses these too.\n- You can find these **rectangular markers** on the sides of the roads in Québec. The colours can vary. NOTE: These can be rarely found on urban divided highways in New Brunswick.\n- You can find these **diamond-shaped markers** on the sides of the roads in Ontario. The colours can vary.\n- In Ontario, you will often see these types of guardrails. They consist of **cylindrical wooden posts**, held together by precisely **three metal wires**. Some posts are marked by a reflective white band.\n- These flat, **yellow bollards** can be found on the Trans-Canada highway in New Brunswick.\n- The Northwest Territories has a black and white bollard with a cylindrical shape and two **thick**, **black **bands. NOTE: It looks very similar to the Alberta bollard. However, the Alberta bollard has thinner black bands.\n- The transformers on poles will **face **the road in British Columbia and New Brunswick, while in other provinces, it will be **parallel **with the wires.\n- Transformers on Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia will be installed at a 45° angle relative to the road. On PEI, red numbers will usually be written on the side.\n- These distinctive pole tops are most commonly found in Ontario. They have two insulators to the **side**, and one on **top**. The side insulators are affixed to the pole with a distinct** **attachment. Sometimes, multiple of them can be stacked on top of each other. NOTE: They can occasionally appear in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, or other provinces more rarely.\n- Some Québec poles have recognizable pole tops with insulator rods that are **angled slightly upwards**.\n- Québec poles may sometimes have a vertical **black and yellow **label.

It is fairly common to see 7-digit numbers with the area code omitted. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Provincial flags** appear decently often, so it is worth learning them. The Fleurdelisé of Québec in particular is very common. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Bins made of **wood **planks can be seen on Newfoundland driveways. These are most commonly **octagonal**,** **however they can have other shapes. NOTE: Although they are most common in Newfoundland, they can also sometimes be seen in other provinces, such as New Brunswick.\n- **Acadia** is a French-speaking cultural region in the Canadian Maritimes. It does not have clearly defined borders, but is usually understood to at least include north and east New Brunswick. It has its own flag, which is very commonly seen in this region. The flag is a French-style tricolour with a yellow star in the blue band. NOTE: There are some isolated Acadian communities in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island (shaded pink on the minimap)."

                "description": "- Shown here is a **Köppen climate map** of Chile. Chile is a long and narrow country that spans more than 4,000 kilometres from north to south, meaning that its climate varies significantly due to latitude. The northern parts of the country, which lie in the tropical zone, are dry and arid, leading to a mild desert climate. In the centre, around the capital, the climate becomes less arid, leading to a temperate mediterranean climate. In the southernmost regions of Chile, which lie in the subantarctic zone, the climate is cold and wet, leading to a cool oceanic climate. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Chile uses a memorable regional road naming system, where the first letter increases between A and Y from **north to south**. For more information on specific regions, see here.\n- Chilean phone codes will sometimes have a **two digit** area code in front, followed by seven digits. The patterns of the codes are easily memorable. Most of the central states also have different area codes for specific provinces, which can help you make accurate guesses.\n- The Atacama is an extremely arid desert covering the northern third of Chile. Some parts of it experience the lowest rainfall on the planet.

The road number is displayed on the left.\n- Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible Slavic languages with several similarities such as acute accents above vowels (á, é, í, ó, ú, ý). However, they both have some distinct letters: - Czech uses the letters **Ř**, **Ě** and **Ů**; - Slovak uses the letters Ľ, Ô, Ä, Ŕ and Ĺ. NOTE: Acute accents on vowels are not found in South Slavic languages.\n- The Czech landscape is fairly rolling, with a lot of hills and altitude changes, but not a lot of tall mountains.

NOTE: While these roadlines can be found in all neighbouring countries, it is notably also common in Germany.\n- Czechia uses **arrow-shaped** directional signs with a filled in tip. Due to the shape, they are recognizable from behind. NOTE: Slovakia has small white arrows instead.\n- The borders of Czech road signs are almost always **separated from the edge** by a strip in the same colour as the sign background. NOTE: In Slovakia, it is more common for signs to have the border on the edge of the sign.\n- Czech highway signs can be either blue or green, and have a thin white border, which is separated from the edge by a **second** coloured border. NOTE: Slovak highway signs have a white border right on the edge.\n- The most common type of street sign in Czechia are **bright red** signs, which can either be wide and stuck on walls, or thin and attached to signs posts. Note that other street signs do occur in some areas, most notably in Brno. Similarly designed blue signs are also fairly common. Furthermore, the Czech word for street is “ulice”, unlike most Slavic languages which use “ulica”. This word is usually omitted, but finding “ulice” on street signs is still possible. NOTE: Slovakia typically uses white street signs with a red border and blue text.\n- House numbers in Czechia are generally written on **blue** or **red signs** with thin white borders. NOTE: On the contrary, Slovak house numbers are typically written on **white signs**** **with a thin red or black border.\n- Czech sign posts typically have **thick, black caps**. NOTE: While some European countries have similar caps, Slovakia usually does not have them.\n- Czech pedestrian signs have **five** stripes. NOTE: The stripes on Slovak pedestrian signs are a smaller scale. This is noticeable when comparing the outermost stripes to the edge of the triangle.\n- Czech road signs have a fairly** thin font**. NOTE: Slovak signs normally have a much bolder font. The same font is however used in Luxembourg and Germany.\n- Czech kilometre markers have a yellow outline outside the black frame and do **not** have a black horizontal middle line. NOTE: Slovak kilometre markers typically have a black horizontal middle line and do **not** have a yellow outline.\n- Bicycle signs in Czechia are yellow. You may also find markings similar to hiking markers, but with yellow stripes instead of white.\n- Suburban houses in Czechia are commonly connected in **pairs**. NOTE: This is less common in most neighbouring countries, including Slovakia.\n- Much of Czech Generation 3 coverage was taken **during winter**, resulting in very grey, and occasionally snowy, coverage. NOTE: This is not common in Slovakia.\n- A white Google car is present in Czechia but not Slovakia. NOTE: Other European countries can have a white Google Car.\n- Czech railway crossing signs do **not** have a background.

However, they can be distinguished from each other by their angle relative to the road. In Estonia, the marker will be **perpendicular** to the road. It has numbers on both sides of the marker. For a quick overview of all three Baltic countries, see this infographic.\n- Each Baltic country has a slightly different border for its warning and speed signs. Estonian signs have a **thin** red border, with **no white outline** around it (the red border extends all the way to the edge of the sign).\n- Estonia has normal A-type guardrails with **no reflectors**. NOTE: The other two Baltic countries can have reflectors on their guardrails. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- Estonian pedestrian signs have **3 stripes**. The shape of the pedestrian has a relatively high level of detail, detailing **shoes** and an **attached head**. NOTE: Lithuanian signs also have 3 stripes, but the pedestrian looks less detailed. Latvian pedestrian signs have 5 stripes.\n- Estonian bus stop signs have this design. The bus has **four windows**. This is mostly useful to distinguish it from the Latvian bus stop sign, which has five windows. Note, however, that Lithuania has the same bus stop signs as Estonia.\n- These **blue and white** signpost wrappings are very common in Estonia. NOTE: They are also common in Finland and Sweden.\n- **Estonian** belongs to the Finnic languages, a branch of the Uralic language family. It is closely related to Finnish. Within the Baltic languages, the following letters are unique to Estonian: - Vowels with umlauts (two dots): Ä Ö Ü. - Õ with a tilde. NOTE: Latvian and Lithuanian are both Indo-European languages that are not related to Estonian, and therefore look very different.\n- The Estonian words for street and road are **tänav** and **tee**, respectively. These words are unique to Estonian. Tänav is often abbreviated as ‘tn’. Many streets, especially in urban areas, have a simple name that completely lacks the tänav and or tee suffix. NOTE: The Finnish suffix -tie, meaning street, can look similar.\n- It is fairly common to find **oval-shaped** blue house numbers in Estonia. NOTE: This is not common in the other Baltic countries, but can also be found in Russia.\n- Estonian architecture generally consists of a combination of wood and white brick, typically with somewhat steep corrugated metal roofs. Painted stone walls are also somewhat common. While wooden buildings can be found in all three Baltic countries, they are more common in Estonia.\n- Directional signs in Estonia are blue with white text and a white outline. NOTE: In Finland, the arrow is built into the white border instead of being an icon inside the border. The arrow on Latvian signs is more stylized than in Estonia and Lithuania, where the back part of the arrowhead is vertical.\n- Generation 3 coverage in Estonia often has a slight green tint to part of the panorama, which is referred to as “**green blur**” by the community. For many players, this green blur can be hard to identify at first. The location shown in this tip’s image is a fairly extreme example. To familiarise you with how it might look in-game, here are some more examples where it is fairly visible: 1, 2, 3, 4. NOTE: This discoloration usually does not occur in Latvia and Lithuania. It can however also be found in Sweden, often on the island of Gotland.\n- The Generation 3 coverage in Estonia is more extensive than the other two Baltic countries, meaning that a lot of **very rural roads** are covered. As a result, if you are considering guessing in one of the Baltic countries, and your location is Generation 3 on a very thin and rural road, you are slightly more likely to be in Estonia. Of course, use caution. This meta has many variables, and is not always reliable. Only use it as a last resort in no-info Baltic roulette rounds, when you have no better clues available."

NOTE: Åland has small, fully white plates with blue lettering.\n- Where present, outer road lines will always be **solid white lines**. NOTE: Unlike Sweden and Norway, Finland does not use dashed outside lines. The only exception to this are the Åland Islands in southwest Finland, which do use dashes.\n- Finland has several different types of **middle road lines**, including: - white dashes, with or without a solid white line next to it - solid yellow with white dashes - double yellow. Yellow lines are being phased out and are increasingly rare in newer coverage. NOTE: Sweden never has yellow middle lines. Norway has middle lines that have a distinct orange tint.\n- Finland has **long black-and-white bollards** with a rectangular, white reflector on the front and two dots on the back. They can be either round or thin and curved. The black strip is typically diagonal. NOTE: They can look somewhat similar to bollards found in other Northern European countries. This infographic shows the differences.\n- In Finland, it is common to find **orange snow poles** with a thin white band near the top. NOTE: These are also found commonly in Norway and Sweden, but with a much wider white band, lower down on the pole. They can also have multiple white bands, while Finnish snow poles usually have just one band.\n- The **Finnish language** is not related to most other European languages, so it has a very unique look. It has a lot of long words and double vowels. The Finnish alphabet includes the letters **ä** and **ö**. NOTE: Estonian is closely related to Finnish, so it can look similar. Estonian uses the letters õ and ü, which are not used in Finnish.\n- Most Finnish street names end in “**tie**” or “**katu**.” These are the Finnish words for road and street. Street signs most commonly have a white background with black text. NOTE: You may find roads ending in “polku” and “kuja”.\n- Finnish road signs have a **yellow background**. NOTE: Signs in Sweden and Iceland also have yellow backgrounds. Norway, however, has signs with a white background.\n- On traffic signs that have a red border, you will find a thin **yellow stroke** on the edge of the sign. NOTE: You will not see this in any other Nordic country.\n- Finnish pedestrian signs have **5 stripes**. NOTE: Pedestrian signs in Sweden and Norway **usually** have 4 stripes. In rare cases, you can find 5 stripes in Norway.\n- Finnish **directional signs** consist of a solid blue background, white text, and a white border with guiding arrows.\n- Finnish chevrons are **black with yellow arrows**. NOTE: Norway and Iceland have similarly coloured chevrons. Sweden, on the other hand, has unique blue and yellow chevrons.\n- Finland primarily uses **wooden utility poles**. Most of them tend to have a simple design, but they can have a variety of poletops. Poles often have a street light attached to them. NOTE: In Northern Europe, wooden poles are also common in Sweden, Norway, and Estonia.\n- Lamps attached to wooden poles in Finland are normally mounted to the **top **of the pole with a **double bolting**. NOTE: Within Scandinavia, Sweden also uses double bolting. However, in Sweden the lamps are mounted further down and the lamp arms are usually not straight.\n- Traffic signposts often have **blue and white** striped markings. NOTE: This pattern can also be found in Sweden. While the same colour scheme is also common in Estonia, the markings typically have a wider shape and attach to the signpost in a looser way.\n- Most of Finland is covered by dense **boreal forests**. Pine trees are common, as well as birches, which are easily recognizable by their white trunks.\n- A lot of **Generation 3** coverage was taken in **autumn**, meaning that trees in this coverage often have distinct fall colours. NOTE: This is significantly less common in Generation 3 coverage in the other Nordics. This means that when you are faced with a tough decision between countries, a fall vibe can be a good clue for Finland. Take note that this season meta is not present in Generation 2 and Generation 4 coverage.\n- **Lakes** are so common in Finland, that the country is also sometimes known as the Land of a Thousand Lakes. Usually, you do not have to drive long to find a body of water.\n- **Finnish architecture** is mostly modern and utilitarian. Downtown areas tend to be very modern, with lots of apartment buildings and use of concrete. Suburbs mostly consist of freestanding single family homes. Many houses have wooden cladding. Like Sweden and Norway, some wooden buildings, especially in the countryside, are painted in a distinctive dark red colour.\n- Finland has two styles of **bus stop signs**, a blue and white one, and a yellow and black one. NOTE: This can be used to tell Finland apart from Sweden, which has many different bus stop signs (example), most of which have the names of the stops on them.\n- **K-Market** and **S-Market** are two Finnish supermarket chains with recognizable logos. Both chains operate only in Finland. K-Market is sometimes known as K-Supermarket or K-Citymarket.\n- Google used a weird, low-quality camera in Finland. This camera is known as the **official Ari** (or “Shitcam”). It has a wide circular car blur, and can be distinguished from Generation 2 by its lack of a sky halo and often somewhat brownish colours. A good map will not usually include this coverage, but it is good to be aware of its existence, in order to not be caught off-guard by it. NOTE: Within Europe, Finland and Spain are the countries that have the most coverage with this camera. This camera should not be confused with unofficial coverage, which is also common in Finland.\n- Finland also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: All of Northern Europe also has smallcam."

Learning the regions can help with cutting down on scanning time for 5k’s, or give you a rough region to plonk in during quick no move games. NOTE: Major roads with 2-digit road numbers do not adhere to this geographic pattern.\n- Snow poles which have **2 long reflectors** can be found on bigger roads in Lapland. NOTE: They can only be found in coverage from 2023 onward.\n- Finland has a lot of farmlands, but the majority of them are concentrated near the west and south coast.\n- **Wind turbines** are most commonly found along the **west coast** of Finland, with some exceptions.\n- **Small, stunted trees** with spindly, thin trunks are common in northern Finland.\n- **Generation 3 snow coverage **is only found in far northwestern Lapland. NOTE: Be careful: this tip is specifically about regular Generation 3 coverage. Generation 2, 4, and trekker snow coverage can be found elsewhere.\n- The **Swedish language** is common in some coastal areas in the south and the west. In these areas, bilingual Swedish or Finnish texts are common. If you see Swedish language in a Finnish setting, do not guess inland.\n- The **Sámi languages** are spoken in the far north of Finland. In this region, you can sometimes find bilingual signs with place names in both Finnish and Sámi. Unlike Finnish, its alphabet uses the letter **c**.\n- This slightly **tilted, long antenna** can be found in southwestern Finland. NOTE: Do not mix it up with the straight long antenna.\n- Generation 3 coverage with **no antenna** at all can be found in south-central Finland.\n- **Åland** is a group of islands off the southwestern coast. It is an autonomous, mostly self-governing region of Finland with its own flag. Though it has a special status, for country streaks purposes it is still counted as part of Finland. NOTE: Åland has no Generation 4 coverage.\n- Åland is **monolingually Swedish**. If you see only Swedish, and no Finnish language, but you suspect that you are in Finland, consider the Åland Islands.\n- Åland roads have two unique aspects that separate them from the rest of Finland: their pavement tends to have a **red tint**, and they have **dashed** outside road lines that resemble those found in Sweden.\n- Licence plates on Åland are white with blue text, making them appear almost completely white on Street View. They are noticeably quite **short** and **lack** the European blue strip on the left side.\n- Some pedestrian signs on Åland have **four stripes**, with the exact same design found in Sweden. Beware that many pedestrian signs will still be the typical Finnish design.\n- Bus stops on Åland include a **white plate** with 4 numbers. Some also include this semicircle sign on top.

Some older French plates lack the right blue strip, with the rear plate being **yellow**. These are very rare in newer coverage. NOTE: Italian plates also have two blue strips, which are equally visible. In addition, Italian front plates are considerably shorter.\n- **French** is a Romance language that is closely related to languages like Catalan, Spanish and Italian. It uses these diacritics and special letters: - Accent aigu: é - Accent grave: à, è, ù - Accent circonflexe: â, ê, î, ô, û - Trema: ë, ï, ü, ÿ - Ligature: œ - Cédille: ç with a small hook In addition, the -ux suffix is only found in French. NOTE: Other European countries with sizable francophone populations include Belgium, Luxembourg, Monaco and Switzerland.\n- The French word for street is “**rue**”.\n- The French bollard is extremely recognizable and appears very often. It is a **round white post with a pointed top** and a reflector band going all the way around. The band can be grey or red. Some rare variations have a fully red top. NOTE: A bollard that is commonly found in Scotland looks similar, but has a blunt top instead of a pointed one.\n- A different round white bollard, with two reflective indented bands, is unique to France. You can also find this design in other colours like green or yellow.\n- Less common wedge**-**shaped bollards with **wide** **rectangular white reflectors** on both the front and back are also unique to France.\n- Concrete poles with step-like indents are common in France. They are referred to as **ladder** or **waffle poles** by the community. NOTE: They are also common in Spain.\n- Wooden poles and thin octagonal metal poles are very common in rural areas and small towns.\n- Small** blue **rectangular markings on** utility poles** are unique to France. They are often referred to as ‘stickers’ by the community, but are actually small plates. You will find these plates on almost all wooden and metallic poles, but not as often on ladder poles.\n- Diamond shaped pole tops with three wires are commonly called “French poletops” within the community. They are most frequently found on top of ladder poles. NOTE: Within Europe, “French poletops” in conjunction with ladder poles are also common in Spain.\n- Some variations of the French pole tops have the insulators on top. These variations may resemble an arrowhead and are unique to France.\n- France has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Western Europe also has smallcam.\n- Small **yellow signs** displaying the road number, which typically starts with a “**D**”, are unique to France. They are commonly placed on top of directional signs or town entry signs.\n- French directional signs are usually white with a black outline slightly offset from the edge. They have an arrow-like shape, with the black border getting thicker at the point. Highway directions have either a blue or green background. Smaller places and points of interest are frequently written in an italic font.\n- Town entrance signs in France have a red border with a thin white outline.\n- French road signs have a red border with a thin white outline. You will often find white rectangular signs with black text below traffic signs. NOTE: Road signs in Spain have a thick red border that goes all the way to the edge.\n- Many traffic signs in France have flat rectangular signposts. _Signposts, along with signbacks, can be dyed with unorthodox colours, more so than in other countries. Some of those are regional, which you can learn more about in the regionguessing section._ NOTE: The only other European countries with flat signposts are Portugal, Spain, and Andorra.\n- Traffic signs with particularly **short signposts** are very common in France.\n- France uses chevrons with white arrows on a blue background. They can have a wide amount of arrows, ranging from one to five. NOTE: The only other European country with this colour scheme is Spain, where you will only find chevrons with two or four arrows.\n- Pedestrian crossing signs in France have five stripes and a disconnected head on the person. They have the usual white border of French traffic signs. Less commonly, you can find a design with two dashed lines instead of stripes.\n- Kilometre markers in France most commonly have a yellow or red semicircle on top of a white rectangle. They can be found in the form of a waystone or as a flat sign and can be either parallel or perpendicular to the road. Major highways can have square markers with a red top.\n- Typical French roads have long spaced out dashes on the outside.\n- These middle road lines, where each dash consists of two **offset blocks**, are unique to France. They are not extremely common, but when you see them, you can safely guess France.\n- Middle lines with **dashes that are longer than usual** can be a good clue for France. NOTE: Unusually long dashes are also common in the UK.\n- These arrows on the road signalling the end of a passing zone are only found in a couple of European countries, including France. In France, the middle dashes will be very close together in these areas. NOTE: Other countries where this style of arrow can be found are Spain, Portugal and Romania. These arrows can also be found in the UK, but they will point towards the left lane instead of the right one.\n- France uses A-type guardrails, usually without reflectors. On rare occasions, you can find thin B-type, the standard guardrail in Czechia and Slovakia. NOTE: Spanish, Andorran and Belgian guardrails use yellow reflectors.\n- Roads may be lined by tall rectangles on a stick in the colours of the Austrian flag, which are not found elsewhere.\n- French architecture largely consists of stone houses, which will normally be either unpainted or painted in greyish or yellow pastel colours. The roofs will typically have a simple gable design, with orange tiles or less commonly black slates. Townhouses will often lay wall to wall along the road. Do note that France has some of the most diverse regional architecture of any European country, so don’t be surprised to see towns that look significantly different from the previously described architecture.\n- House numbers in France are most commonly blue, typically written in a serif font with slightly exaggerated shapes. This is most useful when differentiating from Italy, which almost never uses blue house number signs. NOTE: Similar designs can be found in all other neighbouring, as well as many other, countries.\n- French car brands Peugeot, Renault and Citroën together make up almost half of all cars in France. NOTE: These car brands are also common in linguistically related neighbouring countries."

                "title": "Regional and department-specific clues",
                "description": "- This guide will mainly operate with two types of administrative divisions: **regions**, totalling at **13** in European France, and **96 ****departments**, which appear on google maps as the primary administrative divisions. Other rarer divisions you may come across include pre 2016 regions, historical provinces, and regions based on cardinal directions. Departments are often named after physical geographical features and their logos may show up on various infrastructure, shown in the next tip. _You can practise them with this quiz._\n- French telephone numbers are 10 digits long, with the first two pairs of digits being two separate area codes, following two patterns: - 01 is in Île-de-France and 02-05 goes **clockwise **from the northwest. - 2X is in the far north, with the numbers generally increasing **anticlockwise**. 9X is an exception, being found both in the far northwest and far southeast. Secondary area codes in Île-de-France can be seen on this map. NOTE: Phone numbers beginning with 06-09 are not regional.\n- Each department has an assigned number to it, arranged mostly alphabetically. This is most useful in postal codes, consisting of 5 digits, the first two representing the department they’re in. NOTE: the same regional codes are used inside the right blue strip on licence plates.\n- Most departments have their own unique logo (formally called official flag), often containing stylized initials or the entire name. Notable infrastructure with department logos include bus stops, kilometre markers, trail banners, directional signs and signbacks. Learning what each logo looks like is not recommended for beginners, but it can be helpful to know what they stand for when scanning. You can find the full list of logos here, or see them projected onto a map here.\n- A red and yellow logo with an Occitan cross and vertical stripes is the official flag of the Occitanie region. The rest of the regions also have logos, which appear less frequently. You can see them projected onto a map here.\n- A flag made up of red and yellow stripes, based on the Senyera, is the official flag and department logo of **Pyrénées-Orientales**. You will often find the pattern used in coats of arms on street signs. NOTE: The flag of Provence looks similar, but with vertical stripes instead.\n- Roads with a significant** red**, **purple** or **burgundy** tint are most commonly found in an area between Paris and Dijon, with Normandy being a notable exception. The historical region of **Burgundy**, which gave the name to the shade of red, roughly corresponds to the highlighted area. NOTE: Normal roads may deceptively look reddish under some lighting, so use this with caution.\n- **Dark green** road signposts and backs are most commonly found in Brittany and around Paris, but also various southern regions in the country. NOTE: Beware that this, and the following coloured infrastructure can rarely be found in other parts of the country.\n- Signbacks in Eure-et-Loir may include a **green sticker**, the department’s logo. They’re usually placed on a dark green back, without a matching post.\n- Still in Eure-et-Loir, this is also where D-roads with a **superscript number** are most common. On the map, these are expressed as decimals, e.g. D134.10 and D121.9. NOTE: They are rarely found in other departments.\n- A **greyish green** signback supported by a **darker green** post, is found in three areas: Brittany (Côtes-d'Armor and eastern half of Ille-et-Vilaine), Pyrénées-Atlantiques and rarely near the Alps.\n- In the Pas-de-Calais department, you may find road signs with the following colour arrangement: a **dark green post** paired with a signback of a **lighter shade of green**, ranging from matcha green to greenish turquoise. The department’s logo, a green and blue triangle, is occasionally present on the signback. NOTE: Under certain lighting, they can appear similar to the greyish road signs mentioned in the previous tip.\n- Road signs where both the** post** and **back** are painted **brown** are most commonly found in Seine-et-Marne, and rarely in Ille-et-Vilaine. It is more reliable when the post is **square**, however round signposts are equally common.\n- Directional signs in Haute-Garonne often use **burgundy red attachments** and ornaments. This is sometimes paired with yellow signposts.\n- Most town entry signs in Marne follow a unique format: Instead of having separate entry and exit signs, they are combined into a **single, noticeably thicker block**.\n- Street signs in the metropolitan area of Paris often say the** name of the city**, which is generally atypical for street signs in France. The signs will often be made in a **modern design**, and many city names will be** river based**, notably named after Seine and Marne. NOTE: This can be seen sporadically throughout the country, so consider other clues.\n- Cuboid barriers made of** stones** and mortar are commonly found on Corsica. While by no means unique to Corsica, it is good to consider the island when you see them in rounds with a plausible Mediterranean landscape. NOTE: Stone barriers with a rounded top are not found on Corsica.\n- This is a topographic map of France. Notably, the tallest mountains are found in the southeast and on the Spanish border. The north and the west coast is generally quite flat or rolling, while the southern half is often hillier.\n- Rural roads surrounded by hedges blocking the view, reminiscent of the British Isles, are primarily found in the northwest, particularly in Normandy. NOTE: Hedges by themselves are not sufficient for recognizing this area and are common all over France.\n- **Stone pines** are commonly found along the southern coast, often planted alongside urban roads. You may however find them as north as Nantes.\n- Forests made up entirely of Maritime pines (pinus pinaster) are found in the southwest of the country (Gironde and Landes departments). The whole area will be fairly flat, which is not typical of other areas with such pines.\n- France is the second largest wine producer in the world, with many famed wine regions. The most common include the area around Bordeaux, southern coast and Champagne, East of Paris. Other regions include, but are not limited to, Loire Valley, Alsace and Corsica. NOTE: This map is highly simplified, see this map for more detailed and extensive description.\n- **Sunflowers** are mostly found in the southwest of the country, particularly around Toulouse.\n- Wind turbines are considerably more common in the north of the country.\n- **Black shingle roofs** are primarily found in the northwest, the rough cutoff being the Loire river. Other areas include near the Belgian border, the south-centre, and the Pyrenees, making black roofs a good clue for Alps-Pyrenees toss-ups.\n- **Brittany** has one of the most recognizable and consistent architectures in the country. Common elements include, in addition to black roofs, edge chimneys, black slate walls and stones surrounding doors and windows. The walls will be either very light coloured or made of stone.\n- Roofs in the south of the country will often be made up of rounded tiles overlapping one another, often varying in colour.\n- Rows of dark red brick houses, most similar to Flemish architecture in Belgium, are unsurprisingly found near the Belgian border. The individual bricks may be outlined by white mortar.\n- In and around Toulouse, mainly in old towns, you will commonly find **bright orange brick buildings**. They differ from brick houses near Belgium by the bricks being brighter, as well as somewhat Mediterranean looking architectural features, such as wooden shutters, being common.\n- Walls made of uneven **cream coloured **to **orange stones**, glued with mortar and often incorporating **red brick details** can be found in the towns surrounding Paris. Note that the city of Paris itself generally does not have this architecture.\n- The French Riviera will mirror many characteristics of Monaco. Rich areas with planted **palms** and light coloured multi story buildings with **wide balconies** are good indications you’re in this area, with the rest of the southern coast and Corsican Bastia sharing similar vibes. NOTE: Just like Monaco, several cities host boat trekkers in their harbour.\n- White houses with, often colourful, timber framing are a staple of Basque architecture that extends beyond the Basque speaking area. The timber frame colour (in this case red) will be consistent with other wooden elements, like window shutters and gates. NOTE: They’re also common in parts of Northern Spain, where the timber frames are usually unpainted.\n- Alpine architecture, unmistakable for its light coloured base and extensive **wooden** elements, is unsurprisingly found in the Alps. NOTE: Similar houses can be found in the touristic parts of Pyrenees.\n- Many elements of** Germanic architecture** are concentrated in Alsace, such as **timber framing** and half-hip roof. Furthermore, roofs with fish scale tiles are more common in this region. Beware that these elements are sometimes incorporated into architecture in other parts of France, and are most reliable in conjunction with one another.\n- France is home to many minority languages, 6 of which will be covered in this guide: - **Alsatian**, a dialect of Alemannic German. - **Basque**, the only European language isolate. - **Breton**, a Celtic language. - **Catalan, Corsican **and **Occitan**, Romance languages which are related to French. However, French, legally the only official language, is dominant in all regions of the country, so don’t exclude highlighted regions when you’re placed in an all French round.\n- **Breton** is a Celtic language, visually most similar to Welsh. Common letters include **d**, **k**, **w **and the letter** ñ**, which is not found in French. It is commonly found on the Breton peninsula, with bilingual street signs as east as Rennes and rarely Nantes. The Breton word for street is straed**.**\n- Towns with the **Plou-** prefix are concentrated in Northwestern Brittany.\n- **Alsatian**, a dialect of German, is occasionally found in Alsace, a region that changed countries 4 times in modern history. Most bilingual street signs use some variation of gasse or strasse. NOTE: Streets containing German names are also concentrated in this region, though not as consistently.\n- **Occitan** is a Romance language closely related to Catalan that’s sparsely concentrated in the South of France, most often found on street signs in big cities, and very rarely on town entry signs. It can be divided into dialects, each using a slightly different word for street, all similar to Catalan “carrer”. For example, in Toulouse, you’ll find the Languedocian carrièra and in Avignon carriero, in the Provençal** **dialect. Click here for a more extensive infographic. NOTE: The street sign designs pictured are also unique to the two cities respectively.\n- Bilingual signs in **Basque**, a language isolate, are concentrated In the western half of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department, bordering the Basque speaking regions in Spain. Common letters include K, X and Z. On directional signs, it’s written with a **thinner font**, which is unique within all minority languages in France. The word for street is karrika, in contrast to “kalea” in the Spanish Basque country.\n- On the island of Corsica, you may find bilingual signs in **Corsican**, a Romance language that utilises many features found in Italian, like words almost always ending in vowels. In particular, the endings** u/iu/ju**, changed from o/io, are common in Corsican. Moreover, placenames will usually have an Italian origin.\n- The far southern department **Pyrénées-Orientales**, also known as Catalunya Nord (Northern Catalonia), uses **Catalan** on their various signage. It is closely related to both Spanish and French, with Ç being considerably more common than in French. The word for street is carrer.\n- Knowing basic toponymy in France is crucial for regionguessing, particularly suffixes. This map shows one of the most common and useful endings, with rare exceptions. Other, extraordinarily rare suffixes can be found here. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Many French cities contain the name of the **river** they lay on, usually in the format **-sur-[river]**. On signage, sur are often shortened to ˢ/, in this case Chalonnes-sur-Loire (Chalonnes upon Loire). The picture shows five of the longest and therefore most common origins of river based names, but cities can bear the name of any river, regardless of length. Similarly, city names containing -sur-mer (=on sea) or -plage (=beach)** **are found exclusively on the coast.\n- Réunion is an overseas department and region of France, east of Madagascar. As such, it is counted as France for country streaks purposes. Plonk It has a more in-depth guide to Réunion here.\n- Saint-Pierre and Miquelon is a self-governing territorial overseas collectivity of France, south of Newfoundland in Canada. As such, for country streaks purposes, it is counted as France. Plonk It has a more in-depth guide to Saint-Pierre and Miquelon here.\n- Martinique is an overseas department and region and a single territorial collectivity of France, in the eastern Caribbean. For country streaks purposes, it is counted as France. Plonk It has a more in-depth guide to Martinique here."

                "description": "- Mansard roofs, also known as French windows, are a very common feature of Parisian architecture. They’re made up of steep black shingle roofs with inserted dormer windows. While not unique to Paris, it is a good clue in abundance and on wide boulevards.\n- On the Breton island** Belle-Île-en-Mer** you can find houses typical for Brittany combined with colourful façades and outlines, superficially similar to houses in Portugal. NOTE: The entire island was only covered with an often oversaturated Generation 2 camera.\n- **Lavender fields** can be found in the southeast, appearing as small grey bushes when not fully grown.\n- **Salt farms**, which appear as flooded trenches with grass medians, are found along the Atlantic coast, most notably around Guérande, Noirmoutier, Île de Ré and Île d'Oléron.\n- **Paris**, **Lyon** and **Marseille** are the three largest cities in France and the only ones divided into **municipal arrondissements **(Arrᵗ or Arrt.** **for short). The arrondissements appear on google maps, so finding these street signs can help a lot with pinpointing. The street signs of these three cities will be further described in the following tips.\n- Paris uses an iconic** green & Prussian blue **design with a top arch that has also been replicated in Bucharest, which is sometimes referred to as Paris of the east. NOTE: The simple rectangular form of the sign can be found in the towns nearby and rarely in other cities.\n- Lyon’s street signs feature four corner bolts and an **uninterrupted inner white border** that cuts a **notch** for the arrondissement and each bolt. NOTE: Outside Lyon proper, the street sign will display the name of the suburb instead.\n- **Marseille**’s street signs will usually feature the city’s **emblem**, a variation of the Greek cross. The white border will usually be **interrupted** at the top, even when the cross is absent.\n- Small tables with “**Arrᵗ**” written on a small separate sign, are found in **Bordeaux**, despite being a city not divided into arrondissements.\n- **Montpellier** street signs will typically contain a blue **‘M’** on a white background in the top left corner.\n- Street signs with a red slanted fleur-de-lis are unique to **Lille**.\n- In the outskirts of **Bordeaux**, you may find square traffic signposts with the Bordeaux shade of **red**, named after the wine grown in the region. NOTE: Red posts by themselves are not unique to Bordeaux, so apply this meta with caution.\n- On the French Riviera (Côte d'Azur in French, literally translated as **Blue Coast**), you can find regular traffic signposts painted azure blue. Uniquely, Cagnes-sur-mer, west of Nice, will feature lighter, powder blue infrastructure. NOTE: Blue infrastructure can be found to a lesser extent all across France, particularly Brittany, so consider the landscape as well.\n- **Thin B type** guardrail, typical for Czechia and Slovakia, is sometimes found on **highways** in the northern half of the country, often coming from Le Mans, Tours, Paris, Reims and Metz. NOTE: On the highlighted sections, thin B can be the minority guardrail, and short sections of any highway will have no guardrails at all. It is also more common on smaller roads in the North, but less consistent as a clue.\n- On rare occasions, you may find a flag attached to the antenna in the generation 3 coverage. While much of the highlighted areas has been overwritten, learning the distribution of each antenna can yield very high scores. NOTE: All pictured colourful antenna flags are unique to France."

                "description": "- All car coverage in Germany was taken with a **Generation 4** camera. NOTE: There are some Generation 2 and 3 trekkers, and spill coverage with older dates.\n- Germany uses these **black** and **white** bollards, with white and light-grey reflectors. The reflector will be orange on bollards next to intersections.** **They sometimes have plates containing the road number, and potentially other useful information. Many bollards also feature blue attachments on the side. NOTE: Many European countries have similar bollards, however most will have different coloured reflectors. Luxembourg uses almost identical bollards, but they have 3 bolts instead of 2 on the reflector.\n- The official language of Germany is **German**. The German language uses the special letters Ä, Ö, Ü and ß. NOTE: The other majority German-speaking countries with coverage are Switzerland, Austria and Liechtenstein. In addition, German is spoken in East Belgium and the Italian province of South Tyrol.\n- Most wooden poles in Germany will feature a rectangular** white sticker**.\n- Germany has a wide variety of different poles and pole tops. The most common pole tops being the horizontal bar with uneven hanging insulators, Triangle pole top, and all kinds of T-Shaped pole tops, which can have varying insulator setups.\n- Germany also has a wide variety of sign backs. Notably, you can commonly find **black** or **dark grey** sign backs, which are rather rare in Europe. Most signs will also feature this sticker, with an upside-down red triangle on a black rectangle. NOTE: Italy, Romania and Albania also have black sign backs, however landscape should be sufficient to tell them apart.\n- Like Austria, Germany uses a wide variety of regional bus stops, all of which have the big **yellow** and **green** **H** symbol on them.\n- Mailboxes in Germany are **bright yellow**, and feature this black logo.\n- You will find an excessive amount of bollards on most roads in Germany. Around every 50 metres to be exact.\n- German town entry signs are **yellow** with black text and have a **metallic frame**. NOTE: These signs can include a lot of useful information too: - !!The town and or city name on the top. - !!The Municipality in the middle. - !!And the county on the bottom.\n- Germany uses these **blue** rectangular kilometre markers with slightly rounded edges and a white border. NOTE: In some rarer cases, they can be white too.\n- German pedestrian signs have **five stripes** and the person has a **belt**. NOTE: The same design is used in Luxembourg.\n- These one-way traffic signs, with the word ‘**Einbahnstraße**’ written on them, are unique to Germany. NOTE: In Austria, there will be “EINBAHN” written on the sign.\n- “No Stopping” and “No Waiting” signs in Germany will often have **white arrows** drawn on them.\n- Circular stickers, that are usually green, are found on the bottom right of the windshield on almost every car in Germany. Not as useful to know, but they will have the number 4 written on them. They can rarely be yellow or red instead, and will have the numbers 3 and 2 respectively.\n- **Wind turbines** are far more common throughout Germany than in any other European country."

                "description": "- Using the surrounding elevation can be crucial to getting good guesses in Germany. Here are some general rules: - The north and especially northwest is very flat. - Central Germany is hilly. - Very southern Germany has big mountains. Also note that despite having a higher elevation, many parts of southern Germany can still be flat.\n- German **area codes** are grouped by their first digit. You can practise them by playing this map.\n- **Postal codes** are arranged in a counter-clockwise fashion, starting with 0 around Saxony and ending with 9 in northern Bavaria and parts of Thuringia.\n- Each German state has their own flag. Many of them are rare to find, though.\n- Each German state also has their own coat of arms. They are found on unblurred licence plates and some official buildings.\n- These are some of the more useful and common suffixes for regionguessing Germany. Due to their Slavic origins, endings like **-ow** and **-itz** are primarily found in the east, whereas place names ending in **-weiler** and **-ach** are mainly located in the southern half.\n- While most of Germany uses **B-Type** guardrails, A-type guardrails are common in the northwest, as well as in Rhineland-Palatinate and parts of Bavaria. NOTE: There will always be rare exceptions. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- **Bicycle direction signs** typically feature a white background with green lettering. In Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia and a neighbouring part of Lower Saxony, you will instead find red lettering. The Saarland has its own distinctive design, with white text on a dark green background.\n- You can use the backs of street signs to regionguess Germany. Here are examples of a folded, and flat sign back.\n- You can also use the sign back connectors on street signs to regionguess Germany. NOTE: The double connector on triangular signs are generally wider. T-shaped connectors may look like this.\n- The German Alps is the most mountainous region in Germany, it is mostly concentrated on the Austrian Border.\n- Baltic Pines or Pinus sylvestris are generally more concentrated in the **northeast** of Germany. They can be recognized by their orange-tinged trunk. NOTE: This map is very approximate.\n- You can spot trees that are painted white close to the bottom of the trunk in the northeast. NOTE: You will rarely find them outside the shaded region.\n- The flat plains southeast of **Regensburg** can be recognised by the **slight ridge** often visible to the northeast. The plains themselves are **flat**, and quite **agricultural**.\n- Vineyards are mostly concentrated in the **southwest** of Germany. However, there are a couple regions further east as well.\n- You can find hop fields in these regions. They are commonly seen just north of Munich.\n- These brick houses are generally concentrated in **northwestern** Germany. NOTE: This map is very approximate.\n- **Thatched roofs** and **rock walls** are most common on the North Frisian Islands, as well as mainland Schleswig-Holstein. You can also commonly find them in coastal **resort towns** in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\n- Houses with **black slate walls**, resembling fish scales, are commonly found in a large area of central Germany.\n- These **large**, utilitarian **apartment buildings** constructed during the socialist era, that are also known as “Commie blocks” are common in all of former East Germany.\n- Bollards with **darker reflectors** than usual are found in these regions.\n- Some bollards in North Rhine-Westphalia have a **green** bit at the top. The top can also be another colour.\n- Some of the green caps will have the text ‘**LVR**’, along with a small **coat of arms**. These specific green caps are unique to southern North Rhine-Westphalia.\n- These **round wooden** bollards, which have a painted top, are found in Bavaria.\n- These irregular looking bollards, which do not have a white encasing on the bottom half, are found on K-roads in this region of **Lower Saxony**. K-Roads in this region will not have any other type of bollard.\n- These **simple orange posts** are most commonly found in Bavaria, and also in the other highlighted states.\n- Many trees in Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern have these **tiny green markers** on them. You can very rarely find them in Lower Saxony.\n- Bavaria uses these white rectangular road markers, which are divided by black lines into **three sections**. The left section provides the road you are currently on.\n- You can find these simple **rectangular** markers, with **rounded edges** in Lower Saxony.\n- These markers with a **metallic border** around the marker itself are found in Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony. NOTE: The numbers after the comma are usually smaller on the markers in Lower Saxony.\n- These **triangular** posts are commonly found in these regions. You can go more in-depth with them, too. - Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony use unpainted, rocky-looking posts, with white plates stuck on each side. - Saarland, Thuringia, and Baden-Württemberg use white posts, with the same white plates attached. The posts are usually quite tall, except in Baden-Württemberg, where shorter ones are used. - Baden-Württemberg also uses grey posts. - North Rhine-Westphalia uses white posts without white plates on the sides. You can also find posts which go all the way to the ground. - Hesse barely uses these posts at all. However, when they do, it is quite unpredictable.\n- These basic **white plates** on bollards can be found in these states.\n- Bollards standing on these **black disks** are commonly found in all of **eastern** Germany.\n- Rhineland-Palatinate is the only state where the plates on the bollards are **orange** instead of white.\n- Similarly, Baden-Württemberg is the only state where the plates on the bollards can be **grey** instead of white.\n- These **white** posts with a **red cap** are found in all of former East Germany, but most commonly in the state of Saxony-Anhalt.\n- **Fully yellow** posts are found in the state of Brandenburg.\n- Yellow posts with a white plate on them are found in Saxony-Anhalt. NOTE: Sometimes there is only 1 plate, which can make it hard to tell apart from a Brandenburg post.\n- These **round concrete poles** are almost unique to Former Eastern Germany.\n- These **trident-like** pole tops can be found in Bavaria, Saxony-Anhalt, and Baden-Württemberg.\n- **Triangle** pole tops similar to the ones in Czechia and Slovakia are common in Western Germany. NOTE: There may be some exceptions outside the highlighted areas.\n- These pole tops where the **middle** of the horizontal bar is **thicker** can be found in all of former East Germany.\n- Pole tops which have a **curved** horizontal bar can be found in Bavaria, though they are rare.\n- You can find this rare **white** and **black** Generation 4 car in Hamburg and around Frankfurt. NOTE: You can also find the same car around London and in Ireland.\n- There are two regional Aldi chains, which have split Germany in two; Aldi Süd in the south, and Aldi Nord in the north."

Because commercial vehicles are really common, you will often see a mix of both plate colours. NOTE: Nigeria has similar white plates, but a green tint should be visible, which helps differentiate them.\n- Ghana is mostly flat with **red soil**, however hills and mountains can be seen in some regions. **Tropical **vegetation is very common, and palms are common especially toward the south.\n- Taxis in Ghana typically have **multicoloured** body panels. The fenders and quarter panels are always coloured orange-yellow.\n- Road lines in Ghana are **always white**. However, many paved roads do not have road lines at all.\n- Ghana typically uses **wooden **poles with **3 insulators** on a metallic crossbar.\n- Ghana is a patriotic** **country, and you can often see things painted in the national **flag’s colours**: red, yellow, green, and sometimes including the black star.\n- **Black and white **striped signposts in Ghana are typically seen in cities. On rural roads, you will mostly see classic, non-painted, metal signposts. NOTE: Black and white signposts can be seen in other countries as well. Make sure to look at other clues before guessing."

In the east and north, you can find the ‘peeled tape’, which unlike the ‘unpeeled tape’, is slightly **peeled off**. North of Kumasi, and west of Tamale, you can find this ‘scotched tape’, which has two distinct **white spots** on the left side of the tape.\n- Northern Ghana features a **savannah** landscape, which can be identified by its dry soil and less dense vegetation.\n- **Tall mountain ranges **in Ghana are typically seen near Lake Volta in the highlighted area. NOTE: Mountain ranges to the east are more common in the area near Togo.\n- **Dense forests** in Ghana are typically found in the southwest and east.

See the tips below.\n- The road connecting the town of Sawla with the N10 has very crisp,** new road lines**. Most of the road runs in a general east-west direction, through a lush savannah landscape. The middle line can be solid or dashed. NOTE: There are a couple of other roads with crisp road lines like these, however these tend to have a different road angle or landscape.\n- The Salaga-Tamale road up to Kpalbusi is a dirt road with very moody **overcast **coverage. The soil tends to be **very dark**, with a purple or brown** **tinge to it. The road also has a unique tropical savannah feel. The soil is most dark near the town of Salaga. NOTE: Unpaved roads with overcast coverage and a savannah landscape can be found in other places. The unique aspect of this road is the dark purplish brown soil and the especially dark cloud cover.\n- The road between Nkwanta and Domanko is **unpaved**, with a **powerline** close to the road to your east or northeast. The road itself runs in a general SE-NW direction, through a lush savannah landscape that is typical of central Ghana. NOTE: In urban areas, there can be a powerline on both sides of the road. In addition, a section of the Salaga-Tamale road has a powerline to the east as well, but the darker soil and moody cloud cover makes it distinguishable.\n- On a section of the N2 east of Lake Volta, you can often see a **ridgeline to your southeast**, somewhat close to the road. The road itself also has a distinct angle, running in a general SW-NE direction. The sky is very overcast and grey.\n- The coastal area just **east of Accra**, especially on the N1, has a distinct landscape: it is very flat and wide open, with significantly less vegetation than the rest of southern Ghana. Some parts can look somewhat dry.\n- The section of the N1 road near the border town of Elubo is **very new**: it has dark and unblemished asphalt, a very crisp-looking middle line, and no outer lines. The vegetation is dense and occasionally features palm trees. NOTE: This new road surface continues until the town of Azuleti. The middle line can be dashed or solid. Near Azuleti, the road does not have a middle line.\n- The **Keta Lagoon** in the southeast of Ghana can be seen on the road that runs along it, with the lake being most visible in the northern section. You can sometimes see grey rocks on the side of the road. The soil is quite sandy in comparison to the rest of the country, and it should have a coastal feel.\n- Several nature reserves and sanctuaries have this unique car. A **white** car and side **mirrors **will be visible instead of the regular car, however, the ‘Ghana tape’ will still be there.\n- The Ankasa Game Reserve has a unique Google car. The entire front of the Google car **can be seen,** with only the actual camera blurred. The roof of the car will have a street view vinyl and the ‘Ghana tape’ will be present.\n- The Boabeng Fiema Monkey Sanctuary has a unique Google car. The ‘Ghana tape’ and roof rack will **not **be visible however, the **black right side mirror** will be slightly visible just outside the blur. NOTE: The red soil and surrounding vegetation should still be good clues for the country, despite the lack of the typical car meta associated with Ghana."

When blurred, you can sometimes see the outline of the rainbow. Front plates are required in Hawaii.\n- Hawaii is the only state to use its own language, though English is still predominantly used. Most **place names** are in Hawaiian, so you can spot it on street signs, and other road markers. - Hawaiian is a vowel-oriented language that only uses eight consonants: H, K, L, M, N, P, W, and (ʻ), called an ʻOkina. - Every Hawaiian word ends in one of 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, or U. - Each vowel can also have a macron) over it: Ā, Ē, Ī, Ō, and Ū. These vowels are often combined to make Diphthongs. I.e. UI, AI, AE, etc...\n- Hawaii has a large amount of Generation 4 **\"smallcam\"** coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front, with parts of the car being visible. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot.\n- Hawaii is known for its **lush** and **tropical** vegetation, with a variety of plants and trees. However, being a volcanic island chain, Hawaii has a wide range of landscapes, and as such vegetation as well. You will often see plenty of ferns, tall grass, or other flowers on the sides of the roads.\n- Topography on Hawaii is characterised by many **sloping volcanoes**, rugged **cliffs**, **hills**, **valleys** and **craters**. Such distinct topography combined with tropical vegetation is a good way to identify Hawaii.\n- Contemporary Hawaiian homes are typically 1 or 2 storey wooden structures, commonly lighter in colour. Many homes feature **retaining walls made of volcanic rock.**\n- Thick **yellow** bands can sometimes be seen on poles in Hawaii. NOTE: Make sure not to confuse this with the 3 stripes found on Californian poles.\n- Hawaii uses highway shields that resemble a **guitar pick**, with the numbers on the bottom of the shield. Most highway signs also use yellow signposts.\n- A **stubby antenna** can be seen in most Generation 3 coverage on Hawaii. NOTE: The antenna is not always visible, so make sure to look out for other clues before guessing.\n- Hawaii has a fair amount of **Generation 2 coverage**, compared to other US states. Especially on more rural roads. NOTE: Generation 2 can be recognized by the lower quality camera, and circular blur above and below the camera.\n- **Raised pavement markers** in Hawaii will commonly be placed in a specific pattern: a single reflector, followed by four reflectors put close together and then a single reflector, repeating the pattern."

Moreover, all four of the so-called **interstate** highways are located on Oʻahu.\n- On the three largest islands, namely Hawaiʻi, Maui and Oʻahu, smallcam coverage was taken with a **black Google car**.\n- Smallcam imagery on the islands of Kauaʻi, Molokaʻi and Lānaʻi was captured by a **white car**. Just like with the black car, you will often be able to see the unblurred hood and mirrors.\n- **Generation 2** and **non-smallcam Generation 4** coverage can only be found on the islands of Hawaiʻi, Maui and Oʻahu. The other islands only have Generation 3 or smallcam coverage.\n- The Island of Kauaʻi is the furthest west island in Hawaii with official Google coverage. This island has deep red soil and has large **rugged hills** with lush, jungle-like vegetation. NOTE: Other islands such as Maui and Molokaʻi have similar soil colours, but the hillsides on them will typically have less dense vegetation.\n- The Island of Oʻahu** **lies southeast of Kauaʻi. It is known for being home to the Honolulu urban area. It also is home to **steep, lush hills**, which can be commonly seen from all around the island, especially in Honolulu’s suburbs.\n- Honolulu, located on southern Oʻahu, is by far the **largest city** and urban area in Hawaii. If you are in a dense urban area and can see tall buildings, you will always be in or near Honolulu.\n- The Island of Molokaʻi is just southeast of Oʻahu. It features **deep red soil** and a prominent volcano on the eastern end of the island. Especially in the older Generation 3 coverage, the vegetation appears very dry. Molokaʻi is also very sparsely populated.\n- The Island of Lānaʻi is a small, yet distinct island that lies just south of Moloka’i. A volcano is found just east of the centre of the island, adjacent to the town of Lānaʻi. In this area, tall **Cook pines** are abundant. In addition, some main roads near the centre of the island are lined with younger Cook pines.\n- Towards the coasts of the island of Lānaʻi, hills dotted with **dry grass and shrubby vegetation** are commonly seen. These areas are very rural with few buildings.\n- The Island of Maui sits southeast of Molokaʻi. In the centre of the island, you will find dry and somewhat flat grasslands with one or **both** of the **mountain ranges** on the island visible.\n- Coastal areas of Maui are noticeably more** lush and green**. Banana plants, palm trees, and views of the mountains are all common.\n- The Island of Hawai’i (also referred to as The Big Island) is both the largest and farthest southeast island with Street View coverage in the state. The interior areas feature **rolling, grassy plains **and** volcanic rocks**. You can typically see one or more of the island’s volcanoes from the road.\n- The coastal areas of the island of Hawai’i are where most of the towns and **built-up areas** on the island are located. These areas are typically more lush and have more trees and fern plants than the interior.\n- **Rural roads** going through forests within a flat landscape are commonly found south of the city of Hilo, on the island of Hawaiʻi. NOTE: Mountainous forests are dotted around Hawaii, but if you are in one, and you see red soil with Generation 3, consider guessing in Kauaʻi, the westernmost covered island.\n- Within Hawaii, a distinct **green blur **can only be seen on the island of Oʻahu."

It is the only area on the island with an ‘urban’ vibe. As it is on Molokaʻi, the soil is somewhat red.\n- The **Red Hill** can easily be recognised by this unique barren, red rocky landscape. Due to the high altitude, clouds are usually visible below you.\n- On the eastern side of the island of Molokaʻi lies the Kamakou volcano, leading to a significantly hillier and slightly more vegetated landscape than the western parts of the island.\n- Kahoʻolawe is a small island that lies just to the southwest of Maui. It only has **trekker** coverage on small gravel roads and dirt trails, and is characterised by dry, shrubby vegetation, rolling hills, and **dark red soil**.

It is a Chinese **Special Administrative Region**, so for country streaks purposes, it is counted as part of China. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Hong Kong has **white **front licence plates and **yellow **rear** **licence plates. The licence plates can be long or short. Some cars have an additional black mainland Chinese licence plate.\n- Hong Kong drives on the **left**. NOTE: Singapore also drives on the left, however Taiwan drives on the right.\n- Hong Kong is a densely populated city with millions of inhabitants. In urban areas, modern **skyscrapers **are common, with **busy** streets filled with vehicles and pedestrians. The city has a unique vibe that you can quickly pick up on. In many cases, this vibe alone should be sufficient to identify urban Hong Kong locations.\n- There is also a plethora of rural locations that are harder to identify. Outside the urban areas, Hong Kong is generally quite **mountainous**, with green, subtropical vegetation. There is extensive coverage in rural areas outside the city, with many roads going through the mountains. You might see low-rise rural buildings, however usually you will not need to travel far to see tall apartment blocks. NOTE: Singapore, on the other hand, is very flat.\n- One very striking aspect of Hong Kong architecture are the many extremely **tall apartment buildings** found throughout the city. NOTE: Apartment buildings in Singapore and Taiwan tend to be not nearly as tall as those in Hong Kong.\n- Because of the subtropical climate,** air conditioners** attached to the walls of apartments are very common in Hong Kong.\n- Hong Kong has two official languages: **English and Chinese** (legally, no variety is specified, but residents primarily speak Cantonese). Bilingual signs are common, with English next to traditional Chinese characters.\n- Cylindrical grey lamp posts with a **wide base** are common. Many lamp posts have a white sticker.\n- Utility poles will never be seen in urban rounds, however you might see **cylindrical wooden** poles in rural areas. The poles can be single or double, with electricity counters or transformers attached to them.\n- In Hong Kong, you will almost **never** see striped kerbs, which are extremely common in Singapore. In addition, grey pedestrian guardrails are also common.\n- Hong Kong uses **yellow** pedestrian crossings. Some intersections have yellow grids.\n- Hong Kong usually uses **white centre** lines and** white or yellow outer** lines. These lines can be single, double or dashed. Roads are also commonly made of concrete. Yellow outer lines are most commonly found on small roads to indicate no-stopping.\n- Road signs are white and rectangular, with a thick black outline and **bilingual **text.\n- Give way signs feature a white upside down triangle with a **thick red** border and bilingual text.\n- Distinct weathered rock walls can be seen on the side of mountains. Some of them have nets, to prevent rockslides. In addition, **green or blue plaques** are a common sight.\n- Most fire hydrants are red, and usually have **circular tops** and three protrusions. There is also a pipe-like variant. Some fire hydrants have other colours, so make sure to look at their shape or other clues before guessing.\n- **Yellow **bollards with a white arrow in a blue circle are commonly seen at pedestrian crossings, but also elsewhere, indicating where cars should go. There is a flat and a cuboid version.\n- Distinct **bright orange** bins can be found on sidewalks.\n- Hong Kong taxis come in two variants: sedans or station wagons, with the **sedans **most commonly seen. They can be easily identified by their silver roofs, green stickers on the front and rear bumper, and the taxi sign on the roof. Red taxis are most common on Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, green taxis in the New Territories in the northern region and blue taxis on Lantau Island and Chek Lap Kok. Keep in mind, Hong Kong is a small city and taxis travel all around it.\n- Buses in Hong Kong are mostly **double-decker**, with various colour schemes and adverts on the side. Single-decker versions do exist, but are less common. Smaller minibuses can also be seen, with a green or red roof. NOTE: Place names are sometimes visible on the front of the buses, which can be useful for region guessing. Double-decker buses are also somewhat common in Singapore, but these will often have a recognizable light green colour scheme.\n- **Boxy **houses that are a few storeys high are a common sight in small villages, mostly to the north of Hong Kong."

It can be recognised by its green-and-orange platforms, single-level train cars and the fact that the tracks are separated from the street.\n- Mong Kok and the surrounding districts in Kowloon can be recognized by the crowded, **busy, gridded streets**, with apartment blocks situated above the shops. NOTE: These buildings are usually older, which means there will be a lack of glass walls (as opposed to parts of Hong Kong Island which feature more glass).\n- The north-western area near the Mainland China border is mostly flat and features a patchwork of waterlogged** rice paddies**. The Shenzhen skyline is visible in the distance, to your north.\n- The Central District can be recognized by the large concentration of modern **skyscrapers**. The district feels quite busy, affluent and well-kept, with lots of luxury brand stores and ads.\n- You can use these two **skyscrapers** to determine whether you are on the Kowloon or Hong Kong Island side. The IFC is on the Hong Kong Island side and the ICC is on the Kowloon side. The ICC has straighter edges and looks more like a cuboid, while the IFC is rounder. The IFC will also have noticeable vertical window frames, while the ICC has none.\n- Mid-Levels is a residential district that is easily recognized by the non-identical tall modern apartments and **hilliness**.\n- The residential district of Sai Wan Ho has a lot of identical **white and brown** apartment blocks, and tall glass office buildings.\n- Chek Lap Kok Island and the Boundary Crossing Facilities can be recognized by the various large scale **construction **works going on in the area. From the outside, it can be identified by the many **bridges**** **that connect other parts of Hong Kong to the two islands.\n- The residential district of Caribbean Coast and Tung Chung has **identical **apartment blocks that face the same direction, almost like a “wall” of buildings.

The road is also in good condition and the sidewalks are clean.\n- The Tai Chung Kiu Road is a divided road that runs in a north-east direction, and has views of the Shing Mun **River to the west**. The median has palm trees. In addition, a bicycle path runs alongside the road. Further north, Route 2 also runs alongside the river, but this road has more lanes.\n- Fan Kam Road runs in a general north-east direction, and can be recognized by the dense **tropical vegetation** surrounding the road, and sometimes mountains in the background. The road is also quite narrow and does not have any outer lines. Many small villages branch off of the road, south and north of the country park.\n- Lam Kam Road is similar to Fan Kam Road, however it runs in a more **east-west** direction. The road should also feel **busier **with more cars driving along the road and more houses on the sides of the road. In addition, the road is usually wider and a median containing trees can be seen separating sidewalks near the villages.\n- The Kai Tak Cruise Terminal can mainly be seen from the Eastern Corridor, north of Tsat Tsz Mui, and from the Kwun Tong bypass south-west of Kwun Tong. The cruise terminal can be recognized by its shiny, cylindrical appearance, with **triangular windows **along the side.\n- The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge can be seen from the South Perimeter Road, on Chek Lap Kok Island. Its **length **stretches into the horizon, spanning across the ocean. The road itself can be recognized by the **black and yellow** concrete barriers on either side.\n- The roads going to Disneyland are divided, with palm trees along the side of the road with **teal **coloured street lamps.\n- Between Hong Kong Island and Lantau Island, there are three unique islands: Peng Chau, Cheung Chau and Lamma Island, with **trekker **coverage. These islands can be identified by the **lack of cars**, narrow streets, and rural architecture. Lamma Island is also the hilliest of the three.\n- The Lugard Road trekker around Victoria Peak can be recognized by the distinct** black guardrail**, view of the skyline and tourists walking along the path."

NOTE: Newer electric vehicles have green plates.\n- Hungarian bollards are black-and-white, wedge-shaped, and typically have a **red** reflector at the front, and a white reflector at the back. Blue reflectors are also somewhat common. NOTE: Croatian bollards are very similar. They do, however, typically have the reflector closer to the top, and appear somewhat thinner than in Hungary.\n- The most common type of utility pole in Hungary is a **concrete holey pole**, with relatively thin holes going all the way down to the ground. Wooden poles are also somewhat common. NOTE: In eastern Europe, Poland and Romania also commonly use holey poles. Polish holey poles typically do not have holes down by the ground, and tend to be relatively thin. Romanian holey poles normally either have much wider, or much taller holes.\n- Hungarian chevrons are **white on red**. Black-and-white chevrons may also be seen, but are considerably less common.\n- The **Hungarian language** has a unique look, with a very large number of acute accents, umlauts) over o’s, and long words. The letters \"Ő\" and \"Ű\", with double acute accents, are unique to the language. NOTE: Hungarian is also spoken in some parts of neighbouring countries: notably there are large Hungarian-speaking communities in central Romania and southern Slovakia.\n- Hungarian street names typically end with the word “**utca**”. The word “út” is also used for bigger roads. These two words are unique to Hungarian, and translate to “street.”\n- These **green kilometre markers** can be seen along most Hungarian roads. On highways, the numbers correspond to the ones seen on the map in small yellow boxes near exits.\n- Hungarian sign posts commonly appear to be **abnormally tall**, often taller than the Street View camera.\n- Hungarian signs are usually bolted to the sign post using **four bolts**, going through the sign, in the shape of a tall rectangle. NOTE: This is not common in any other Eastern European countries.\n- Hungarian pedestrian crossing signs have **five stripes**. The person is wearing a **belt**. There is also a second, less common, type with four stripes and the person holding a bag. The belt is located noticeably **low** on the person’s body, almost as if the person is sagging his pants. This is unique to Hungary. NOTE: Among neighbouring countries, Croatia and Slovakia also have five stripes and a belt.\n- Apart from European highways, there are two types of numbered roads in Hungary; roads marked with **green signs**, and highways beginning with the letter ‘**M**’, marked with **blue signs**. These road numbers are contained within a small shield shape on the sign.\n- Most directional signs are green, having a white inner border and a green outer border. Directional signs on M-numbered highways are blue, having a white inner border and a blue outer border.\n- It is somewhat common to see a small, grey flag on the antenna of Generation 3 Google cars in Hungary. NOTE: This is also seen in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.\n- A white generation 4 Google car can also rarely be found in Hungary. NOTE: It can also be found in other European countries.\n- A black generation 4 car that will never have an antenna can be found in Hungary. NOTE: A black car can be found in many European countries, though it will often have an antenna visible.\n- The majority of Generation 3 coverage in Hungary was taken **during winter**, resulting in very grey, dead looking coverage. NOTE: This is also common in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria.\n- Hungarian houses are typically made of stone, painted in a light colour and almost always with **red tiled roofs**. Suburban houses are typically only one storeyed, while more central houses may be taller. Houses in town and city centres are often fairly old but well-kept.\n- While Hungarian road lines are all-white, lines on **bicycle lanes** are typically **yellow**."

It can be hard to see the blue of the characters through the blur of the plates.\n- Iceland has unique **yellow bollards **with a white reflector. These bollards are extremely common and can be found throughout the country on almost every section of rural road.\n- Iceland often looks **barren and treeless**. Most regions have a dark grey soil consisting mostly of volcanic rocks. NOTE: Due to the lack of trees, the landscape in Iceland does not look like anywhere else in Northern Europe.\n- Iceland is a very **geologically active** country, where plate tectonics and volcanic processes have shaped the landscape. As a result, many regions are rugged, mountainous and a sight to behold. In addition, strange and bewildering landscapes can be found all over, such as geothermal lakes, lava fields, rift valleys, and towering rock formations.\n- The road direction signs of Iceland are **yellow**. They usually have a white inset box that shows the road numbers. If the inset box has a dashed border, the number listed refers to a nearby road, not the road you are currently on. NOTE: Direction signs for very local destinations, such as farmsteads, typically have different background colours: blue or white.\n- Icelandic pedestrian signs feature **four stripes** and often have a **slight yellow tint**.

The main ring road, which circles the entire island, simply has the number 1. There are no other roads that start with 1. The first digit of the other road numbers is region-specific. These regions have a sequential distribution around the island, starting from 2 in the south and increasing up until 9 in a clockwise direction (see map for approximate distribution).\n- The Westfjords region features numerous narrow fjords, surrounded by moderately tall, and mostly **flat-topped** mountains.\n- The far east of the country is also home to several fjords. What distinguishes them from the Westfjords are the generally larger and more **jagged mountains**.\n- The mountains west of Akureyri contain many valleys, sandwiched between tall, often slightly snowcapped peaks. Most of these valleys generally face north to northeast.\n- Barren landscapes consisting mostly of** dark volcanic gravel**, with little to no vegetation or signs of life, are typical of the inland regions of Iceland. Most such covered roads are located in the east.\n- The Southwest agricultural area in Iceland can be identified by its relatively flat **farmland landscape** scattered with numerous farmsteads, fields, meadows and grasslands. NOTE: Although there are other smaller agricultural areas in Iceland, mountains in this area tend to be quite distant, making it unique.\n- The **wide valley** around Eiðar is slightly hilly and agricultural, with tall, **snowy peaks visible in the distance** on either side, to the east and northwest, respectively.\n- The valley around Hallormsstaður has a distinct northeast/southwest angle with **low-lying mountains** on either side, a **wide river** flowing through it, and an **unusual amount of trees** for Iceland. Some of the sideroads are in the forests.\n- You can recognise the area near the town of Selfoss from its distinct** flat-ridge mountain**. Due to the otherwise flat landscape, this mountain can be seen from a wide area.\n- Reykjavík is the capital and by far the **largest city** in Iceland. The city is mostly flat with slight hills, and is located on the south side of a bay. It is most recognizable as it is significantly larger than other Icelandic cities, with a large urban area and “bigger city” feel. NOTE: The city of Akureyri can feel urban in some places. You can distinguish it from Reykjavik as it has mountains to the east and west.\n- Akureyri is the second-biggest city in Iceland and is located in a **North-South oriented valley**, along the western edge of the bay. The city features mountains ranges to the east and west, making it recognisable.\n- Iceland can be split in half depending on the colour of the pickup truck, with red being found in the southwest, and white being found in the northeast."

The divided highways are shown in dark red, while the highways with three or more lanes are shown in bright red. NOTE: There are two exceptions to this: - Divided roads can be found inside cities other than Reykjavík. Roads may temporarily be divided close to intersections.\n- The Island of Heimaey can easily be recognised by seeing these ragged rocky cliffs overlooking the town of Vestmannaeyjabær. Similar cliffs can be seen on the islands off the coast.\n- Very **foggy coverage** can be found around the town of Bakkagerði, in northeastern Iceland. The fog can also be seen from a distance."

NOTE: Within Asia, Nepal is also entirely “shitcam”, while it’s also common in Cambodia and can rarely be seen in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\n- All the Generation 4 coverage in India was taken using the smallcam, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot.\n- While most of India is covered in shitcam, there is also a significant amount of **Generation 3 trekkers** throughout the country.\n- India drives on the **left side** of the road.\n- A wide variety of scripts can be found in India. Most of them can be used to narrow down the region.\n- **English** is also an official language in India and can be seen on a lot of signage.\n- Indian licence plates are typically fairly long, with the most common design being white.

                "description": "- **Hindi** is the most common language in India and can be found in many central and northern regions. It uses the Devanagari script, which can be recognised by the line going through the top of each word and the straight vertical lines found in the majority of all letters.\n- **Marathi**, found in Maharashtra, also uses the Devanagari script, however it sometimes uses the letter **ळ** which is not found in Hindi.\n- **Punjabi** can be found in Punjab in northwestern India. While the script looks somewhat similar to Hindi, it can generally be differentiated by the softer shape of the letters and the horizontal bar being broken over certain letters. It also has some distinctly different features, such as the letters **ਨ**, **ਲ** and** ਅ **as well as a diacritic in the shape of a soft curve beneath a letter.\n- **Gujarati**, found in Gujarat, has a script with several similarities to the Hindi script, however it notably lacks the horizontal line at the top of every word.\n- **Bengali** is found in northeastern India and has a similar look to Devanagari (Hindi), however it can usually be recognised by the many letters featuring left-facing triangular shapes. NOTE: This is also the language found in Bangladesh.\n- **Assamese**, mainly found in Assam, also uses the Bengali script, with the addition of some characters, most notably **ৰ** and **ৱ**.\n- **Kannada** is found in Karnataka and has a script with a lot of smooth curves and small circles.

Some letters also have diacritics shaped like dots. NOTE: Tamil is also commonly found in Sri Lanka.\n- The **Oriya** script is found in Odisha and has a curvy look, with many letters having wide semi-circles covering the top. Many letters have a distinct diacritic in the shape of a wide curve above the top of the letter. A useful mnemonic is that the shape of the characters resembles a skull emoji.\n- The **Malayalam** script can be found in Kerala and mostly consists of somewhat simple-looking curvy letters, often containing upside-down **U-shapes**.\n- **Manipuri**, also called Meitei, is the official language of Manipur.

There is also a variant having several bars instead of one.\n- In Manipur you can often find **trident poletops **on poles made entirely out of **metal**. They sometimes have small bars on the top of the trident.\n- **Upside down triangle poletops** placed below the top of the pole are commonly found in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and less commonly in Madhya Pradesh.\n- Poles in Madhya Pradesh often have a metal bar shaped like an **upside down A** slightly below the top of the pole.\n- A connector on the pole which looks like an upside down trapezoid is most common in Chhattisgarh and somewhat common in Meghalaya, Tripura and Maharashtra, but can rarely be found in many other states. NOTE: They can also be paired with Holey Poles in Gujarat and Ladder Poles in Andhra Pradesh, thus only use the trapezoid when no other pole meta is present.\n- A variety of poletops attached to the pole with two vertical bars forming a **tall and narrow rectangle** can be found in West Bengal.\n- In West Bengal you may also find poletops containing two crossbars which are connected to each other** **with thin vertical supports on either side. The lower bar is connected on either side to the pole with diagonal supports.\n- In the northeast you may find poles with a combination of an **even and uneven** poletop.\n- Poles with two diagonal bars forming a ‘<’ shape are common in Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh and occasionally found in Assam.\n- In Assam, Meghalaya and Mizoram you commonly see poles with **two crossbars**, each with two insulators.

Large hay mounds are also generally more common in this region. Note that thatched roofs from Uttar Pradesh to Odisha tend to be made of fine pieces of hay whereas thatched roofs from Odisha to Tamil Nadu tend to be made of dried palm fans.\n- Gurdwaras, which can typically be recognised by their white domes and ornate walls, are most common in Punjab. You can also sometimes recognise them by the Sikh Khanda symbol, which represents the religion.\n- Goa and Kerala are two of the most developed states in India and often have very **wealthy and modern homes**.\n- Chir pines are more or less exclusive to Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir as well as in westernmost Arunachal Pradesh. These pines can be identified from their generally smooth-looking conical or spherical crowns with very long needles.\n- Khasi pines are mainly found in Meghalaya and Manipur. While the needles appear similar to those of chir pines, the overall crown formed by its branches will appear more jagged and disorganised.\n- This type of cacti (Euphorbia neriifolia) can commonly be seen as part of fences throughout Gujarat, western Maharashtra and the southern half of Rajasthan.\n- Palmyra Palms have a **round crown** with** fan shaped leaves** and a trunk with consistent thickness, giving them a lollipop shape. If you see them in large numbers you should be in the south or east of the country.\n- Areca Palms can be recognised by their **very thin trunk** and a small crown. They are mainly found near the southwestern coast, in the northeast and on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n- **Date palms** are commonly found in drier areas of the central regions of India where there are fewer tropical and coastal palms.\n- **Oil palm **plantations are most commonly found in the panhandle of Andhra Pradesh, especially near the eastern border with Telangana.\n- **Tea plantations** can be found in the northeast and the far south.

The northern part is drier while the southern part has more vegetation. NOTE: During the rainy season the mountains will turn green and appear quite different.\n- The landscape in Mizoram mainly consists of lush, green valleys with fairly low vegetation with eroded hillsides having many small peaks scattered around. NOTE: A somewhat similar landscape can be found in Meghalaya, however rather than distinct peaks, the hillsides will have a mostly smooth and flat top.\n- Large visible, **square shaped cars** can be found in the areas shown on the map. NOTE: A somewhat similar car with a visible hood on the car can be found in Odisha.\n- In the northeast you will commonly see fences made of thin wooden sticks in a **square pattern**.\n- **Buddhist prayer flags** are found in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh."

They are mainly found in the Mechuka Valley as well as near the Bhutan border in Arunachal Pradesh.\n- Doum palms, which appear similar to Palmyra palms but with **multiple branches**, are almost exclusive to the union territory of Diu.\n- The endangered Indian pitcher plant is exclusive to the Khasi Hills, which are mainly in Meghalaya. They can occasionally be spotted on road sides, especially on the NH206 north of Umlārem.\n- The western half of Uttarakhand is typically **far** **more barren** than the other Himalayan regions, due to logging and erosion. The coverage northwest of Dehradun on the Himachal Pradesh Border has some especially barren hills full of brown grass and small roads next to cliffs.\n- The Mechuka valley is the only place in Northeast India where snowy mountains are visible. The valley contains brownish grass and a plethora of Bhutan white pine. North of Mechuka the coverage gradually becomes overcast and somewhat dark.\n- Chaukhamba, located near the town of Ukhimath, is a mountain massif covered in snow which can be recognised by its **three distinct peaks**, with the centre peak being the tallest.\n- The landscape south of Shillong in Meghalaya, is characterised by V-shaped, green eroded valleys with somewhat flat and smooth ridgetops. NOTE: Mizoram hills are less smooth with more rises and falls instead of long smooth ridges.\n- Salt flats and coastal marshes with nearly **no vegetation**, other than short yellow or brown grass, can be found in parts of Gujarat.

NOTE: Malaysia drives on the left, while the Philippines drives on the right.\n- Indonesia uses **white or yellow** centre lines. Outer lines will always be white. The centre lines will be solid or dashed. In Generation 3 coverage, yellow centre lines are more rare, as Indonesia only recently started using this colour for its road lines. NOTE: Malaysian road lines are always all white.\n- Poles in Indonesia are typically round and made out of either **steel**** **or **concrete**. Many of the steel poles are painted black, and also feature the Indonesian flag colours on them. The pole tops are usually either even or uneven, depending on the region. _You can learn more about regional poles in the region-guessing section._\n- Indonesia commonly uses these **black-and-white** square or circular bollards, as well as these **yellow-and-black** ones, which can also have a red reflector. Other designs can also be found. NOTE: UK-style bollards are mostly found in Kalimantan.\n- Usually yellow waystones that are angled towards the road, and have a cutout close to the top are unique to Indonesia. They include shorthand for three cities or towns, with the biggest one being on the top in the cutout section. NOTE: Waystones in the Philippines are perpendicular to the road and have the text facing away from the road.\n- Indonesian can look very similar to Malaysian, however Indonesian has been influenced by **Dutch**, and Malaysian by English. These small changes in spelling may help differentiate the two. An example is the word television in English, which translates to ‘televisi’ in Indonesian, similar to the Dutch word ‘televisie.’ In Malaysian, it translates to ‘televisyen’, more similar to English.\n- You can find these rows of red and white **banners **all around Indonesia.

Each province is split up into multiple Kabupatens, totalling to 417 which are covered by street view, and therefore applicable in Geoguessr. These are learnable with enough time and patience. _See the resources section for more information._\n- You can find the **cardinal directions** written on many addresses. They are as follows: - North = Utara - East = Timur - South = Selatan - West = Barat - Central = Tengah\n- Indonesia uses two types of pole tops: **even**** and ****uneven**. This refers to the bar that holds the insulators and whether it is symmetrical to the pole itself. Knowing where even and uneven poles are most commonly found is useful for region guessing.\n- You can find these poles with a **triangle attachment** under the horizontal bar in the following regions. NOTE: This does not apply to stacked poles.\n- Poles with an **indent** on both sides are found in West Java, Jakarta, and Banten.\n- **Trident** style pole tops are most commonly found in **Central Java** and Yogyakarta, and rarely in South and West Kalimantan, and North Sumatra and Riau.\n- Bali features both even and uneven poles, as well as the Lesser Sunda island variants. You can also find this unique **rectangle **attachment on the pole tops in Bali.\n- On the Lesser Sunda Islands (“Nusas”), you can find poles with an **extra long support** on the pole top. Sometimes, two supports can be present.\n- Pole tops in North and Central Sulawesi, and Gorontalo commonly feature an **extra attachment** right under the horizontal bar.\n- You can often see thin, black poles next to regular poles near the East Peninsula of Central Sulawesi. Two pieces of tape can be seen near the top of the poles, usually **light blue and green**. These can rarely be seen in northern South East Sulawesi.\n- These poles are almost exclusive to North Sumatra. The bar which holds the insulators is **even**, but features **uneven **insulators with one on one side and two on the other.\n- Satellite dishes can help you determine whether you are north or south of the **equator**. For example, if the satellite dish points north, you are most likely south of it, and vice versa. The angle of the satellite dish can also tell you how far away from the equator you are. The more levelled it is, the closer you are.\n- Central Sulawesi features these unique bollards that are painted **black **on the bottom, **white **in the middle, and **yellow **on the top.\n- These painted fences are typically found on Sulawesi. They will be mostly painted white with blue or red.\n- **Green** paint can often be seen on the side of bridges in South and Central Kalimantan.\n- Within Indonesia, oil palm plantations are mostly concentrated in **Sumatra **and **Kalimantan**. Palm plantations can rarely be seen in Sulawesi.\n- The majority of rice production is concentrated in **Java**, but can sometimes be found in other provinces, namely South Sulawesi and South Sumatra. They can rarely be found in other provinces as well. For a full overview, see this map.\n- The Nusas typically look **drier **than other regions in Indonesia. The islands get especially dry towards the **east**, especially in Generation 3. Vegetation tends to look less tropical, but instead more brown with a lack of leaves. Sumba Island is also the driest of the Nusas. NOTE: While less common, other regions such as Java can look similarly dry. Make sure to look out for other clues before guessing.\n- This **savannah** landscape is occasionally seen on North Sumba. NOTE: In Generation 3, you will always see a white car.\n- **Red** **soil** can often be found on Batam and the Bangka Belitung islands, located east of mainland Sumatra.\n- Tiled roofs are most commonly found on the island of **Java**, and sometimes nearby regions such as southern Sumatra, the Lesser Sunda Islands, and South Kalimantan. NOTE: The tiles on roofs in South Kalimantan and Jambi look slightly different. The tiles are usually less rounded but flatter.\n- Plain sheet metal roofs are more commonly found toward the north, where tiled roofs are **not **found. They are most commonly found on Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Sumatra.\n- These** horizontal slots** inside the **triangles **of the roofs are almost unique to Southern Sulawesi. NOTE: They can rarely be found in East Kalimantan and West Nusa.\n- You can find these distinct roofs with uniquely **high-pitched peaks** on Sumba.\n- **Architecture in Bali** is unique because it was influenced by old Balinese culture and Hinduism. The most important thing to look for are these crown-like roof pinnacles, found everywhere in Bali. Guardian statues and slit-drum towers are common too. Andesite, a dark, volcanic rock, is a common building material in Bali. You can often see gates, walls, and other intricately carved ornaments built from this material.\n- West Sumatra features these distinct **boat-shaped** roofs.\n- North Sumatra features similarly distinct **boat-shaped** roofs, however the roofs are **less angled** upward and they do not feature spires. NOTE: These roofs are most commonly found near Lake Toba, due to its sacred history.\n- On Kalimantan, you can find these unique roofs made out of **wooden **chips.\n- Roofs with **gable horns** can be found most commonly in South Sulawesi, Riau and Central and South Kalimantan. NOTE: Horned roofs are often found with Bugis roofs in South Sulawesi.

The houses themselves are also **elevated from the ground**.\n- In the rare case a licence plate is **unblurred**, knowing regional licence plate codes can be helpful for region guessing. **1 letter codes** **can only be seen in** **Java**, and are mostly found in the west. 2 letter codes can still be seen on Java, but in the east. NOTE: The highlighted areas on the map only refer to the first letter. A detailed map of all the codes can be seen here. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Indonesia is religiously a **Muslim **majority country, so seeing churches, and other Christian signs, is a good clue for these regions.\n- **Generation 3 antenna** coverage is most commonly found on Java, but can very rarely be seen on Bali in and around Denpasar. It is most commonly seen in East Java, as most of the antenna coverage in the west has been overwritten by Generation 4.\n- Black Generation 3 coverage can be found almost everywhere in Indonesia, but is most common in **Sulawesi**."

These dashes can also be seen in New Zealand.\n- You will usually find cream white buildings with black roofs in Ireland. Sometimes, the buildings feature grey corner stones. In cities, you will typically find row buildings. NOTE: British style brick buildings can still be found in Ireland.\n- Ireland is the only European country that uses yellow **diamond-shaped** warning signs. Note that this only applies to warning signs. Regulatory signs (circles and upside down triangles) have the normal red border and white background, like most other European countries.\n- Irish signage is often bilingual, with English in a regular font, and **Irish in italics**. Place names, regular words and phrases are all translated. Irish language is somewhat less common on non-official signage.\n- Irish chevrons are **yellow on black**. Both single and multiple arrows are common. NOTE: UK chevrons are white on black.\n- The yellow warning stickers on utility poles can be a good way to distinguish between Ireland and the UK. The most important difference is that UK stickers feature a guy getting zapped by a lightning bolt. The Irish stickers usually have a lightning bolt, but **lack the guy getting zapped**. They also often have an extra second rectangular sticker with a black outline, below the lightning bolt.\n- Irish yield signs feature the word “**YIELD**”. NOTE: UK yield signs have the phrase “GIVE WAY”.\n- These **green and white bollards** can be a good clue for Ireland. They are not entirely unique to the country, but they are especially helpful in 50-50s with the UK.\n- Rural metal gates with **rounded corners** are very common in Ireland. NOTE: This is mainly useful to distinguish it from the UK, where similar gates typically have square corners. However, gates in Northern Ireland also typically have rounded corners.\n- You will often see a **strip of grass** in the middle of tiny rural roads. Such roads are called “boreens”. While not unique, these boreens can often be a strong clue in a tough 50-50 between Ireland and the UK.\n- Ireland and the UK **drive on the left side** of the road. NOTE: The only other European countries to drive on the left are Malta and Cyprus, but landscape should be sufficient to tell them apart.\n- Most of Ireland is dominated by a very green, agricultural landscape, with lots of **hedgerows** next to the roads and dividing the fields. This type of landscape is also common in many parts of the UK, and can be virtually indistinguishable from Ireland.\n- Both Ireland and the UK use **wooden** utility poles. Pole steps bolted on the side of the pole are very common. These pole steps are shaped like a series of thin horizontal metal rods.\n- In and around urban areas, you will sometimes encounter **double yellow road lines** on the sides of marked roads. These indicate a no parking zone, and are also very common in the UK. They are not really found anywhere else in Europe apart from Malta, but landscape should be sufficient to tell it apart.\n- Pedestrian crossing signs are somewhat rare in Ireland. They are yellow and diamond-shaped, like other road signs. Instead of pedestrian signs, you will often see these **black and white signposts** with a yellow bulb on top. Note that the UK uses exactly the same signposts.\n- Ireland has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot."

                "description": "- Irish **regional roads** have 3-digit road numbers. The first digit of these road numbers gives you a general region within the country (see the infographic). A good mnemonic to remember the rough location of each region: the numbers go in an anti-clockwise direction around the island, starting in Dublin. Two important notes: - There is some overlap between numbers at the borders of each region, as well as some rare exceptions - Roads starting with 8 or 9 are newer roads that are mostly not limited to a certain region (though about half of the 8s are in the Dublin metro area).\n- Irish phone numbers start with a two digit **area code**. The area codes are grouped geographically by first digit, and are therefore very learnable.\n- Ireland’s west coast is defined by a **rugged, hilly landscape**. Steep hills and low mountains dominate. The neat fields of the east make way for wild grass- and moorlands. The grass often has more brownish and yellow tones to it. Sometimes you will be able to see exposed rocks.\n- If a very small rural road has **Generation 4** coverage and is located in an unusually **hilly** landscape, you are likely to be in Donegal. Note that this meta only applies to the smallest roads: thin, without road lines, and sometimes with grass in the middle. This type of coverage is also not exclusive to Donegal, it is just likely to be there.\n- One noteworthy area in the east is the **Wicklow Mountains**, just south of Dublin. They can look deceptively similar to the western coastal mountains. It can be very hard, if not downright impossible to distinguish these two areas. Two things to look out for: - You will never see the coast from the Wicklow mountains. - Like Donegal, its small roads are mostly covered with Generation 4 instead of the Generation 2 that is more typically associated with small roads in the west.\n- An electrical vehicle (EV) with a Generation 4 camera was used to cover most of Eastern Ireland and parts of the Northwest. The **back of the EV is visible** in all this coverage: it is grey with a black semicircle. Note that not all Generation 4 coverage in and around Dublin is made with this car. A considerable amount still has the regular blue Generation 4 car."

Highways are usually in better condition than roads in the south and north.\n- Southern Israel and eastern West Bank are **extremely dry** and sandy.\n- The area west of Jerusalem can often look deceptively similar to northern Israel, with green forested hills and some agriculture sprinkled across the landscape. Two things can occasionally be used to tell the two apart. Firstly, in northern Israel you may occasionally see wide, flat valleys, while the Jerusalem area is always going to be hilly. Secondly, if you see houses made of Jerusalem stone, you are likely to be near Jerusalem.\n- Most of the West Bank has a **semi-arid** Mediterranean landscape. It is generally greener than southern Israel, drier than northern Israel and west of Jerusalem, and hillier and less agricultural than central Israel.\n- In Jerusalem and surrounding cities in the West Bank, nearly every building is built with the same type of material, called Jerusalem stone.

                "description": "- Japan consists of three main terms used to identify land, groupings and borders: Islands, Regions and Prefectures. - **Islands**: The four main islands that make up the country of Japan. From the top they are: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. - **Regions**: Some islands are further broken down into groupings of prefectures. - **Prefectures**: These form the currently 47 different subdivisions within the country. Many of these names are used in this guide, on maps, and when referring to areas of Japan. Therefore, it is recommended to learn and become comfortable with each category, and the titles within.\n- The appearance of the standard Japanese Google car is often **black and white**. You may find it in black or rarely with an antenna. In addition, due to privacy reasons, the camera is intentionally set lower to the ground. This is known as **low-cam**. You can identify it by: - Looking downwards. The blur will be noticeably larger. - The road will look wider, and objects will be viewed from a lower perspective. NOTE: The only other country that always has low-cam is Switzerland. It can also be seen in Generation 4 coverage in Sri Lanka. Also, the car will be blurred in Switzerland.\n- Japan drives on the **left** **hand **side of the road. NOTE: Hong Kong drives on the left hand side of the road, same as Japan. South Korea and Taiwan drive on the right hand side instead.\n- Japanese is written with a mixture of **three main systems**: kanji and two syllabic scripts: hiragana and katakana. Formal signs and texts will mostly use kanji and hiragana. The kanji system is directly borrowed from Chinese and thus looks very similar, while the syllabic scripts are more loosely inspired by Chinese. Hiragana generally looks simpler than Chinese characters, many of the symbols have loops, which are not present in Chinese. The shapes are also typically slightly softer than the shapes present in most kanji. _You can learn more about hiragana, katakana and kanji in the region guessing section, learning frequent terms and names._\n- Katakana is mainly used for loan words, and are thus common to find in commercials. They are generally quite simple, with a lot of geometrical shapes rather than the more artistic shapes present in hiragana and kanji.\n- On the left hand side you can find the pronunciation and meaning of eight of the most commonly featured kanji in town and city names. Learning to recognise these can make finding cities considerably easier. On the right you see the shape and pronunciation of the cardinal directions and the shape of some kanji commonly found at the end of place names. If you see the kanji for prefecture or city, chances are you will be able to find it fairly quickly. Wards are typically findable granted you know the city, while towns are often fairly difficult to locate. NOTE: Most of these kanji have alternative, less common pronunciations.\n- Japanese architecture has many distinct and expressive styles, with many unique buildings. These can range from traditional country houses, regional designs, modern large cities, coastal reinforced buildings, and anything in between. _You can learn more about different types of architecture and styles in the region guessing section._\n- Japan mostly uses these **round concrete** poles, which have these screw-like extensions. Other information can often be found on or attached to the pole including: - Electrical plates. - Guy-wires. - Pole reflectors. Therefore, they are a key asset in region guessing Japan. _You can learn more about plates, reflectors, and guy-wires in the region guessing section._\n- You can find a variety of pole reflectors in Japan. They are typically short and **do not **touch the ground. Common patterns found all across Japan include: - Yellow vertical stripes. - Yellow diagonal stripes. - Vertical or diagonal white stripes. NOTE: The Taiwanese variant has diagonal stripes that reach the ground. The South Korean ones have diagonal, thicker stripes. _You can learn more about the different regional reflectors in the region guessing section._\n- Japan uses a standard **short white** licence plate with green text. You will often see a different short yellow version with black text issued to “light automobiles”, otherwise known as Kei Cars.\n- Japan has three common variations of road lines. They are as follows: - The most common being white, solid outer lines with a dashed white middle line. - White solid sidelines with a yellow solid middle line. - White solid sidelines with yellow and white middle lines. While you may find other, more rare combinations, Japan will never have yellow outside road lines.\n- Japan usually uses simple white bollards with **circular reflector(s)** on the top. However, sometimes these bollards are black, or have other extensions. They can also have the city or prefecture written on it in kanji. _You can learn more about the bollards and kanji in the region guessing section._\n- Japan generally uses these simple, **white** guardrails. _You can learn more about the exceptions in the region guessing section._\n- Prefecture roads are identified by their **hexagonal-shaped** shields. The prefecture is often written under the road number in kanji. While the shield design remains, other variations can be found: - On prefectural highway shields (with kanji). - On directional intersection signs. - Or on small, directional arrow signs. As multiple prefectures can have the same road number, it is recommended to first find the prefecture you are in.\n- Some frequently seen infrastructure in Japan consists of: - This unique stop sign. - A school pedestrian crossing. - And these traffic mirrors. While many infrastructural clues exist, these three are very common, and may very well help you identify Japan on a difficult round.\n- **Retaining walls** can be an excellent clue for Japan in rural areas with little to no information."

NOTE: Area codes ending with a 0 are often not regional, most notably 0120.\n- Every region in Japan features a **distinct plate** on their utility poles.\n- The **pole reflector pads** vary by region in Japan.\n- You can narrow down the prefecture you are in based on the style of **road diamond**.\n- Most Japanese prefectures have unique stickers you can find on their signposts.\n- Most regions in Japan have unique **guy wires**. NOTE: Only the most consistent ones are on this map.\n- You may sometimes find an **orange arrow** located above the top most pole plate in Chugoku.\n- These **orange and black bands **wrapped around poles can often be found in Shikoku.\n- These attachments with an approximately **120-degree angle **can commonly be found on poles in Kansai. NOTE: Sometimes there is no angle, and instead just an angled downward attachment.\n- These smaller attachments with a **90-degree angle **can commonly be found on poles in Shikoku.\n- The electrical poles in Hokkaido either have this **plus-shaped bar** attached to the **side** of the pole, or one transformer mounted on **two bars**. However, if there is more than one transformer, they will often be mounted on the sides of a **square**. NOTE: While the Kanto transformer may also be mounted on two bars, Hokkaido will never have a wooden plate.\n- The transformers in Tohoku, which often have additional square holding brackets and the logo of the Tohoku Electrical Company, are sometimes mounted on a **round plate** with a **zigzag bar**. Furthermore, you may also find transformers mounted on the **side** **of a** **square**, with a straight bar mounted on the top of the square. Rarely, you may find a square without a bar. NOTE: While Kansai may have a square attachment as well, the bar will be mounted on the bottom rather than the top.\n- The transformers in Kanto, which can have three or two insulators, are often mounted on a **wooden plate** and two bars, or a round plate and a T-shaped bar. NOTE: While the Hokkaido transformer may also be mounted on two bars, it will never have a wooden plate. Kanto ones can also be mounted without a wooden plate.\n- The transformers in Hokuriku, which are attached with thin metal bars, often have these **small “lamp” shaped insulators**. There will **never** be a bar present except for the attachment mentioned above. NOTE: The prefecture of Niigata will have the Tohoku transformer design, as opposed to Hokuriku one.\n- The transformers in Chubu, which often have painted **yellow numbers** and **black “tap” connectors**, are either attached with **large** **triangle and horizontal bars**, or these **thin metal brackets**.\n- The transformers in Kansai have either a **straight **or **zigzag bar** mounted on the **bottom** of a **square**. The transformer(s) will be mounted on the sides of that same square. While this is uncommon, the bar and transformer(s) may be mounted on a **vertical bar**, rather than a square. NOTE: While Tohoku may have a square attachment as well, the bar will be mounted on the **top** rather than the bottom.\n- The transformers in Chugoku, which have a **cross-shaped bar** attached in the **middle** of the pole, mounted by a **full triangle**, will have a **long horizontal **or **short vertical**** insulator(s)** at the end. A white sticker will often be stuck to the bottom of the transformer with **red numbers**. They may also be painted on the **side**.\n- The transformers in Shikoku, which also have a **cross-shaped bar **attached in the **middle** of the pole, mounted by a **half triangle**, will have **“hat shaped”** **short horizontal insulators** at the end. A white sticker will often be stuck to the bottom of the transformer with **black numbers**.\n- The transformers in Kyushu, which have a **straight bar** attached on the **side** of the pole with **three insulators** at the end, will have transformers mounted **180-degrees** from one another.\n- Transformers in Okinawa, which have a **T-shaped bar** attached on the **side** of the pole, will have transformers mounted on **opposite sides** of the pole.\n- These **grey “insulator-esque” blocks**, which wires are fed through, can be found in the regions of Chubu, Kansai, Chugoku, Shikoku, and very rarely in Hokkaido.\n- This pole top, with **four thicker bars** and a **circle** **piece** at the top, is common in the Chubu region.\n- This pole top, with **two sides filled in** and shaped like a **tent**, is common in the Hokuriku region.\n- This pole top, with **four thin, skinny bars**, is common in the Chugoku region.\n- This tuning fork pole top, with a **long top bar** that sticks out each end and **horizontal bar(s) **below, is found the majority of the time in the Kanto region.\n- This tuning fork pole top, with a **short top bar **and **horizontal bar** below, is found the majority of the time in the Chubu region.\n- This tuning fork pole top, with a **thin wire** and **horizontal bar **below, is common in the Kansai region.\n- This infrastructural **arrow** informs drivers of where the shoulder line is when under snow, and is located almost exclusively in **Hokkaido**. NOTE: While much more rare, other variations can be found here: - This arrow, found in the Aomori prefecture (or more rarely Hokkaido), has distinct silver bolts around the border. - This variation, found in the Gifu prefecture, is long and thin. - This alternate yellow and black design can often be found on the northern part of National Highway 275 in Hokkaido. - This yellow and green arrow is found southwest of Sapporo. - This yellow and black arrow can be found on Hokkaido.\n- This flat, white bollard, found on the island of Kyushu and in Yamaguchi Prefecture, will have a **series of separated orange reflectors** on one side, and the same white on the opposite. NOTE: Rarely, you may find similar bollards in Hokkaido. However, both sides will have orange reflectors.\n- Some bollards on the island of Shikoku can have a** black stripe** just under the reflector. They can be found normally, attached to guardrails or walls.\n- This **thick**, white bollard, found in the Tohoku region, will have an **octagonal** reflector, and **yellow stripe** just underneath. In addition, you can find the same bollard, but with a rectangular top. Finally, there are two other variations. You can find a black octagonal, and rectangular version. They are often found on National Highways or Expressways and can have the number printed on them.\n- This bollard, much like Tohoku, will be a **thick**, white bollard with an **octagonal** reflector. However, this Akita prefecture variation will have **two yellow stripes **underneath the reflector.\n- The Toyama prefecture bollard has **one reflector**, is **extendable** and has a **red stripe** underneath the reflector. NOTE: Be careful: if there is either a second reflector, or a yellow stripe instead of a red one, these are different bollards. These are more common variations found across many prefectures.\n- This bollard, with an **octagonal** reflector, and **red stripe** underneath it, is exclusive to the Okayama prefecture. Additionally, there will be a sloped connection where the base meets the reflector.\n- This bollard, found in the Aomori prefecture, has **two yellow stripes**, a **single circular reflector**, and is **extendable**. Sometimes, only one thicker stripe near the top may be present.\n- These striped bollards (which cover over the original) have a **thinner** top half, and **no reflectors**, and are common to the Tohoku region. They are especially common in Akita prefecture.\n- In the northern parts of the Chugoku region, you can primarily find these basic snow poles, with either a **thin** **extended**, or **thin contracted** top. They can also sometimes be found in Iwate.\n- Green bands on guardrails are most commonly found in Oita and Miyazaki, but can be found on all of Kyushu.\n- These distinctive **yellow **guardrails can be found in the Yamaguchi Prefecture.\n- You can find these **chevron-like** stickers, or more rarely orange ones, on guardrails** **in Hokkaido. - On the end or side of a guardrail. - Stuck to metal posts between wire fences, which are often found in Hokkaido. - On railings, which are often found on bridges, underneath the inside of the railing.\n- Guardrail endings with these **red and yellow** striped stickers can commonly be found across Chugoku, except in Yamaguchi. They can also rarely be found in Niigata.\n- Vertical traffic lights can be found in Hokkaido, and along the northwestern coast. The usual horizontal traffic lights can be found everywhere else.\n- These specific **black **signs with **two yellow circles** are found in Kagawa. Other variations can be seen, including them stacked on top of each other, or with an arrow attached above.\n- Kerosine tanks, otherwise known as “Claymores”, can be found more commonly the further **north** you go. They are abundant in Hokkaido, but can be found in prefectures south of it, or in high elevation mountainous areas.\n- Hot water, gas and propane tanks can be found more frequently in **northern** prefectures or high elevation mountainous areas. Here are a few common variations you can find: - The standard hot water tank. - Covered propane tanks. - Exposed propane tanks. - These cylindrical tanks. - And finally, these circular tripod tanks. Moreover, these are even more common in rural towns or villages, where major water or gas lines are unavailable.\n- Snow prevention roads, known as ‘Shosetsu’, are found mainly in northwest coastal prefectures. They appear as **tiny circles **in the pavement, and spray warm underground water to clear snow.\n- Cycling routes in **Ehime** use an outside white, with an inside **blue **line. They are more commonly found along the coast but may be found further inland too. While exceptions do exist, and can be found in other prefectures, they are the extreme minority.\n- These unique **red-tiled** roofs are most commonly found in **Chugoku**, especially in the prefectures of Hiroshima and Shimane.\n- The further you are **north**, roofs generally transition from tiled to level or flat sloped in order to compensate for heavy snowfall. Northern houses often have **ladders** attached to the side, giving roof access to clear snow. NOTE: In addition to north to south, high-elevation mountainous regions or high snowfall areas often use such roofs, even in more central or southern prefectures.\n- Okinawa can often be recognised by the white concrete buildings with flat roofs.\n- Giant butterbur (commonly referred to as cabbage) is abundant in **Hokkaido** and some northern prefectures. Plants found south of Hokkaido often have smaller leaves. It is often found growing along the roadside. NOTE: Cabbage is also found on the island of Sakhalin, Russia. However, the Google car will not have low-cam there.\n- Green tea plants are often grown in hedged rows. You will often see these fans mounted on poles, which serve the purpose of preventing frost from falling on the plants. The prefectures of **Shizuoka (36%)** and **Kagoshima (34%)** make up the majority of the production, with Mie (7%), Miyazaki (4%), and other prefectures (17%) making up the minority.\n- Rice is mainly produced north of **Tokyo**. During growth, it resembles straws of grass. And when ready for harvest, brown husks are visible. They are also commonly planted in beds of water. The regions of Chubu (21%), Kanto (15%), Tohoku (27%), and Hokkaido (7%) make up the majority of production.\n- Japanese White Birch grows dominantly in the **Chubu and Hokkaido **regions, and to a lesser extent in Tohoku. Small areas of white birch can be found throughout Japan, so use this information primarily to help assist your region guess. NOTE: Japanese Beech is another species of tree found in Japan. They, however, have more grey and spotted bark, as opposed to the mostly white Japanese White Birch.\n- In general, bamboo grows more often in the **south**, and slowly decreases further north. Population size and areas where it grows can vary, so use this information primarily in helping assist your region guess.\n- Chinese Silver Grass, referred to as Kyushu grass, is indeed very abundant on the island of **Kyushu**. However, use this tip with caution, as they can be seen outside of this area. NOTE: Another notable region they can be found in is the prefectures of Niigata, Yamagata and Akita. Though, combining the rather large quantity found on Kyushu, its normally distinct vegetation, along with other information, there often will be a clear distinction.\n- **Sugarcane** is almost exclusively found on the islands in southern Kyushu and Okinawa.\n- Hokkaido has very **limited** winter and snow coverage. Unless you are certain, it is often better not to guess this prefecture. Though, if you do find yourself in Hokkaido, these regions are most likely. Other low amounts of miscellaneous coverage is primarily in the southern half of the island.\n- Japan is notably a very mountainous country. However, there are some regions that are quite **flat**, being the Nobi and Kanto **plains**. While at times they can look very similar, determining that it is one or the other can be very helpful. NOTE: While there are, of course, other flat areas in Japan, these two are the most recognizable."

The colour and shapes of both can vary.\n- Agricultural fields with red soil are commonly found on several southern islands, most notably on the islands of Miyakojima and Ishigaki in southern Okinawa.\n- **Mount Fuji** is the tallest mountain in Japan, with a gradual incline and often snowy summit. Depending on the elevation, it can be seen from far away. This can create some excellent region guesses, especially if you account for direction and distance.\n- **Tokyo City **features a nice manhole design**, **with a** 5 petal flower** and many small circles on the outside.\n- **Cyrillic **can be found on signs in the cities of Wakkanai and Nemuro, in northern Hokkaido.\n- These artistically painted poles, made to resemble **birch trees**, are unique to the city of Date in Hokkaido.\n- There are a variety of **trekkers and tripods**, covering a vast amount of locations which span over multiple prefectures and regions. _Due to the enormous volume of information on this topic, and it being too large to be contained in this guide, we recommend this resource to learn more about the various trekkers._"

It is a British Crown Dependency, so for country streaks purposes it is counted as part of the United Kingdom.\n- The island is shaped by a unique mix of British and Norman influences. The many **winding roads** and hedgerows are reminiscent of English country lanes, with **tree-covered** roads being particularly common. However, due to Jersey’s unique geographical position, most coverage features **sunny **weather. All images were taken by a **Generation 2** camera.\n- Jersey licence plates follow the British model, having a long **white front** and **yellow rear** plate. In addition, you will notice the island’s red coat of arms on the left, as well as the letter ‘J’ at the beginning of all codes in unblurred plates. NOTE: In contrast to the British mainland, Jersey was never a member of the European Union. This means that local plates do not have a blue strip.\n- In general, road infrastructure is **similar **to that found in the United Kingdom. This includes driving on the left, as well as directional signs, chevrons and warning signs. Some of the subtle differences are discussed below.\n- Due to its proximity to France, the vast majority of street and locality names contain **French **words. The island’s traditional language, known as Jèrriais, is closely related to French and appears on some signs.\n- Similarly, the local **architecture **shares many characteristics with that of northern France. This includes pastel-coloured walls and dark slate roofs. However, British-style terraced houses are also common.\n- Jersey is home to large reserves of **red granite**. As a result, it is a popular building material used for the construction of many **walls **and houses throughout the island.\n- In contrast to the iconic red booths found on the mainland of the UK,** telephone booths** in Jersey are uniquely yellow.\n- **Cornish palms** (Cordyline australis) can be identified by their distinctive thin trunks and arching leaves. They are commonly used as decorative plants on Jersey. NOTE: These palms can also be found on some stretches of the British mainland’s coastline.\n- Jersey uses **yellow give-way lines** at intersections. NOTE: In contrast, the UK typically uses double dotted white lines for this purpose.\n- Jersey has an extensive network of cycling routes. Most notably, you will find signs referencing the start or end of a **“Green Lane”**. Blue **route markers**, containing a map of the island in the centre, are also common.\n- Some road signs are **asymmetrically **attached to their signposts. This appears to be more prevalent on Jersey than on the British mainland. NOTE: Keep in mind that this only applies to a minority of signs. Most are attached regularly."

Commercial transport vehicles, such as taxis, have a distinctive **green strip** on the left. NOTE: In the Middle East, the green strip is only found in Jordan. The UAE also uses long white plates. Israel however only uses yellow licence plates. In Palestine, both white domestic and yellow Israeli plates are common.\n- The official language used in Jordan is **Arabic** and can be identified by its lines and dots. NOTE: Unlike the UAE, Jordan does not have English writing on most commercial signs. This can be helpful to distinguish the two countries.\n- Roads in Jordan typically feature **yellow outside** and **white middle **lines. NOTE: Other Middle Eastern countries such as the UAE and Israel can also have these road lines. Make sure to check other clues before guessing.\n- Jordanian chevrons are **white with red arrows**. NOTE: You can use chevrons to distinguish between Jordan and Israel: the Israeli chevrons are black with white arrows.\n- These are three common electricity poles that you will find in Jordan. Rounded concrete poles have either a **diagonal support** or consist of three horizontal **Y pole tops.** You may additionally see thin, two support metal poles with three vertical coils.\n- Jordan is a **very arid** country, with limited vegetation and a lot of almost completely lifeless desert.

NOTE: Similar sandstone bricks are also common in Jerusalem and in the West Bank.\n- On occasion, the road quality in Jordan is reflective of its age. Roads are well travelled and can be in poor condition. The heat has caused the asphalt to buckle, creating **warped cracks** in the road.

In the south, coverage extends all the way to the coastal town of Aqaba, but not south of it.\n- **Amman** is by far the largest city in Jordan with extensive coverage. It is a bustling, developed metropolis with a distinct **“big city” feel** to it. It is slightly hilly and most of the city consists of medium-sized apartment blocks.\n- **Highway 15** is the longest **divided highway** with coverage in Jordan. Most of the road is surrounded by desert landscape. It is also surrounded by rocky hills in the south closer to Aqaba. NOTE: Highway 35 north of Madaba and highway 40 west of Amman are also divided but do not feature a desert landscape, while the divided highway 80 in the south runs mainly from east to west, making it distinguishable.\n- **Highway 35** connecting Amman and Jerash is a divided road surrounded by hills speckled with green vegetation. NOTE: Highway 40 west of Amman is also divided and features a similar landscape. However, the **T-shaped** lamppost shown in the image is only found on highway 35 which helps distinguish the two.\n- **Highway 40** is a recognisable divided** **road surrounded by low, green shrubbery that makes its way west of Amman through the hilly terrain into the sandy area close to the Dead Sea.

Most strikingly, most of the rural coverage in Kazakhstan is in a very empty, open and mostly flat landscape.\n- A lot of Kazakh infrastructure, from pedestrian signs, poles, houses, to bollards, is very similar to what you see in Russia.\n- Like Russia, Kazakhstan uses **yellow and white stripes** on their pedestrian crossings. However, unlike Russia the stripes often have white dashes on either side. Sometimes, you can find the dashes without the stripes.\n- Street Signs in Kazakhstan are often attached to buildings and are **blue **in colour, with white intricate patterns on the top and bottom. They are usually **bilingual or trilingual** and can also contain a **QR code**. NOTE: They are often inconsistent, with many designs being found in a single city.\n- Kazakhstan uses a variety of post-Soviet style bollards, as well as ones that resemble Turkish bollards. Notably, the bollards seemingly consisting of two thin bollards attached at a **90° angle** are unique to Kazakhstan.\n- The bottom of tree trunks are very often **painted white**. NOTE: This is common in several eastern European countries, as well as in parts of Russia.\n- Unlike neighbouring countries, Kazakhstan primarily uses **yellow and black** chevrons, except on T Intersections, where you will find the more generic red and white chevrons.\n- Gas pipes are extremely common in Kazakh cities.\n- This **ornamental pattern** known as the koshkar-muiz can be found as part of decorations in all kinds of settings in Kazakhstan.\n- Many cities and towns in Kazakhstan have these entrance arcs, which are often quite intricate and ornate."

The codes themselves follow an alphabetical order, with smaller numbers corresponding to regions that start with earlier letters. Note that cars do travel, and as such not all codes are reliable. Buses and smaller utility vehicles are the most reliable.\n- While rarely possible, being able to read the letters under a QR code on a street sign will give you the region.\n- Kazakhstan is a generally flat country, so getting locations that are hilly or mountainous are useful for narrowing the options. For example, the region around Karaganda is often either quite hilly, or you can see hills in the distance. Another notable set of hills would be the ones around Aktobe. And of course getting bigger mountains will mean you are in the south, or east.\n- These **lush birch forests** next to green fields are common in northern Kazakhstan.

The landscape consists of dry but grassy rolling hills or dead flat agricultural land near Zhetisay. NOTE: These red and white KM markers that look like Kyrgyz ones, are only found near Zhetisay.\n- **Grassy** **green rolling hills** can be found in southern Kazakhstan. They are especially common just north of Bishkek.\n- Around Semey, you can find small clusters or entire forests** **consisting mostly of **pine trees** and some deciduous trees, which will have **fall colours**.\n- The divided section of the **E38** goes **southeast to northwest** from Shymkent to Kyzylorda. The road is made of **asphalt**, and it has **all white road lines**. The landscape varies quite a lot; in the south, it is very green and in the north, it gets dry, sandy, and shrubby. Driving direction: Both ways\n- The section of the **M36 **going from Karaganda to Almaty can often be recognised by the road being under construction, with a second lane being built. Yellow lines are common. As for the landscape, it’s a wintery dry steppe, which looks noticeably orange-brown. Driving direction: **South **from Karaganda.\n- Between Karaganda and Astana, the **M36 **is now a divided highway, with **yellow outer lines**. The landscape consists of a grassy, sometimes hilly, steppe with an occasional row of trees along the road. Note that the general **southeast to northwest** road angle is important. Driving direction: Both ways\n- The** P4/A17** from Astana to Pavlodar is a divided road, generally going **east to west**, through a **hilly steppe landscape** similar to the M36, but is generally less vegetated**. **Most of the road has **outer yellow lines**. Driving direction: Both ways\n- The roads from Kyzylagash to Druzhba feature a unique hilly landscape, which looks **hazy** and dead. On most sections, you will see small mountains either south or east of the road. Driving direction: **East **from Kyzylagash.\n- The **A26 **goes from Kandyagash to the intersection of M32/E38. It has very **bad road quality** throughout, ranging from poor grainy pavement, to completely unpaved. Apart from the northernmost section, the weather is either cloudy or overcast. The landscape consists mostly of flat, semi-arid grassy plains. Driving direction: **North **towards Kandyagash. (Mostly)\n- The section of the **A1 **going from Astana to Shchuchinsk is a **6-lane divided highway**. The landscape around is generally **quite green**, with trees and grassy plains or hills. Driving direction: Both ways\n- The **A17 **going to Ulytau Region can be recognised by the **bad pavement quality**, where the edges of the road are almost crumbling away, along with the **single white middle road line**, which can be dashed or solid. The landscape itself is a grassy steppe, with some fall coloured trees occasionally lining the roads. West of Atasu, the sun is distinctly low on the horizon. NOTE: A small section east of Atasu has pristine new pavement, which has a slight red tint to it. Driving direction: **Towards ****Atasu** from both directions\n- The road north of Zhezqazghan has no road lines. The landscape is **very dry, desolate**, with very limited vegetation** **and slightly hilly. The soil can look very red or orange at times. The weather is sunny, with a lot of cumulus clouds. Driving directions: **North **from Nikolskiy\n- The **R260 **road is mostly paved, but not in the best condition; many cracks can be seen, and it** **mostly lacks road lines. The weather is **overcast** and the landscape is a **slightly hilly steppe**, consisting of somewhat yellow grass and reddish soil, which is very evident when the road is unpaved. The **R217 **is very similar, but the road is in better condition and mostly has very faded dashed white middle road lines, which are often quite difficult to see. The further east you go, the more sparse the cloud cover gets. Driving directions: **South **from Atbasar\n- These regions/cities have the most useful pole paints you can learn.

In Generation 4 you will always have a large pickup truck, which will either be white or grey. The grey car comes in two slightly different variations, of which one can either be with or without a snorkel. It is the only country other than Mongolia with a snorkel. NOTE: You can see National Park Cars in other countries with a snorkel on the front of the vehicle. Each vehicle will have its own distinct look.\n- On a lot of the coverage you will see a grey Toyota SUV following the Street View car.\n- Kenya uses **long white** front licence plates. The rear counterpart is **square** and **yellow**.\n- This mobile network brand named **Safaricom **is unique to Kenya, and almost every city has one location.\n- Outer lines in Kenya will always be solid white, while inner lines will be yellow and either solid or dashed.\n- Directional signs are **green **with a white border and text. They often display road numbers in white or yellow.\n- While infrequent, road signs in Kenya will mostly be **red and white**.\n- Upon closer inspection of signs, billboards and posters, you will notice that the **county name** is often written. Therefore, knowledge of Kenyan counties can be extremely useful in region guessing. _You can practise Kenyan counties using the quiz in the resource section._\n- These **repurposed vans** can be found all over Kenya. NOTE: While these vans can also be found in Uganda, the design of the vehicle wrap is clearly different.\n- Many species of **eucalyptus **are commonly found in Kenya. They can be identified by their long, often clumped leaves, and smooth bark. NOTE: Eucalyptus trees can be found in other countries. Use this information to help reinforce your country guess.\n- While the vast majority of Kenyan car coverage has a visible Street View car, it is possible to find Generation 3 coverage with **no visible car**."

And as Bishkek has the most polluted air of any city, there will usually be visible **smog** to the north.\n- These towns east and west of Bishkek feature these **colourful poles** with yellow, green, white, and sometimes red on top. NOTE: Sokuluk will not have the red paint on top.\n- Osh is the second-biggest city in Kyrgyzstan. It is one of several towns that has coverage with the **southern mirror**. This allows you to easily distinguish it from Bishkek. The weather in Osh is fairly good, with some clouds, but **never fully overcast**. NOTE: Manas (Previously Jalal-Abad), the other big city with the southern mirror, will always have very overcast coverage.\n- You can also distinguish Osh from Bishkek by looking at the trees: most still have their **leaves**.\n- In the centre of Osh, you can see these **unique mountains** with radio masts on top of them.\n- Manas (Previously Jalal-Abad) is the third-biggest city in Kyrgyzstan.

This section south of Balykchy is **extremely dry**, with the landscape mostly consisting of **small shrubs**, unless you are next to the Chu river. To the north, you can spot these mountains that have clouds hovering above them. Otherwise, there are no clouds in this region.\n- Further up the road, you enter a **dry valley** with mountains flanking both sides. There is barely any vegetation - just some shrubs close to the ground. The river next to the road brings some more greenery to the area. In the southern half of this section, you can see this slightly snowy ridge to the north.\n- Going further south, you will reach this next valley, which seems equally dry, but the mountains are more rocky and have **trees** growing on them. The road now has very **bad pavement**, and as such you can see dust clouds.\n- Once you get out of the valley, you will notice this area is **more vegetated**, has **more buildings**, and more animals on the now grassy fields. The landscape is still hilly, with bigger mountains to the north, south, and west. The southern mountains are especially distinct, with them being covered in snow. The hills immediately north of Naryn can get very dry, but look out for snow that you can see in the shade.\n- The mountains and hills south of Naryn have a unique combination of **snow** and **red soil** that make them very distinct.\n- The At-Bashi Valley has a very distinct mountain range, which you will see to your south from any section on this road.

NOTE: The weather is completely clear east of this intersection.\n- You will almost always see the **Issyk Kul lake**, and the Tian Shan mountains on this section. The soil here is **sandy and rocky**.\n- The section west of “Fairytale Canyon” has distinct **sunset** coverage.\n- You will see a lot of mountains and hills to the south here, but only some hills to the north, with seemingly nothing behind them. You might even see Issyk Kul behind them. There is still a lot of **sand** on the sides of the roads.\n- The landscape around the western end of Issyk Kul is **drier** than the east. The lake itself and the southern hills are **further away** from the road as well.\n- The EM-17 runs southeast of Talas. Includes **2** tips.\n- This section of EM-17 is **very snowy**. The hills and mountains around the road are almost fully covered in snow. Unlike the other snowy roads, this road is often covered in **uncleared slush** or melted snow. NOTE: This section of road features the Black Dot Mirror.\n- Going further west, only the hills to the **south** will have **snow** on them. The landscape is generally dry, with hills to the north and south of the road. Most of this section features the Black Dot Mirror.\n- The EM-13 is a small gravel road, which sadly only has small bits of coverage. Includes **2** tips.\n- The road going east of Kazarman is an **unpaved gravel road**, between two **hilly ridges** on either side. The ridge to the north is further away, and has a bigger set of mountains visible behind it. The mountain ridge has a unique mountain that towers above the rest.\n- The eastern side of EM-13 closely resembles the road going west of Naryn. (See tip below) This road, however, is an unpaved gravel road in the middle of the Naryn valley, so the hills to the north are now closer. The Landscape is filled with bushes, shrubs, and grass. NOTE: The one town in the region can be recognized by these white-and-red fences with a white diamond pattern in the middle.\n- This road going west of Naryn is situated south in the **dry** Naryn valley. You will typically see hills **close** to the road on the southern side. There are also bigger mountains not too far behind. While to the north, there is a wide plain, with hills and mountains in the distance. Many parts of the road also have a pavement with a salt and pepper-like quality.\n- The road going east of Naryn is also in the Naryn Valley. Here you will also see hills close to the road in the south, and then further away to the north. The plains north of the road are however smaller. This side is also more **built up**, except the road, which is **unpaved** at certain parts. Here, the hills south also have small amounts of snow on them.\n- The M-082 is a unique road, with only a small section being covered, from the shore of Song-Kul to the mountains right south of it. Includes **2** tips.\n- Song-Kul is the second major lake in Kyrgyzstan. The surrounding area features **dry rolling hills**, with patches of snow. The only covered road is made of gravel.\n- The road in the mountains south of Song-Kul is the only unpaved road this **high up** in the mountains. You can see the clouds below you, down in the valleys below. The mountains have rugged peaks, and snowy cliff sides. Many of the mountains also have **spruce trees** growing on them.\n- The M-118 takes you from the resort town Arslanbob down into the fertile Fergana Valley. Includes **2** tips.\n- On this road, you should be able to see the **Kara Darya river** to the east in the valley below the road. The region is generally hilly and green. To the north, you can see some low-lying mountains in the distance, they have some snow on them. The hills east of the river have snow on the top as well. NOTE: This section of road features the Southern Dirty Mirror.\n- There will generally be some **snow** on the ground on this road. You will see more snow depending on how north you are. You will often see the massive Gora Babash-Ata mountain to the north. NOTE: This section of road features the Southern Dirty Mirror.\n- The M-107 is a pretty road connecting Taskomur to Kerben. Only the first half is covered. Includes **2** tips.\n- This section of M-107 is **dry and rocky**. There are a lot of mountains around, but this one ridge specifically can be seen from most of this section. NOTE: This is what the ridge looks like from further away.\n- Going further west, you will encounter a very **hilly** landscape. The landscape features a lot of **vegetation** - tall grass, trees, bushes. This road uses these concrete barriers as guardrails, notice the cement above the gaps. The general southeast to northwest driving direction on this road is also worth noting.\n- This road going all the way to Sary-Chelek lake is one of the most unique roads in Kyrgyzstan. Includes **2** tips.\n- This valley is **full of vegetation**. This area also has a lot of buildings and fences near the road. Most of the road is in poor shape, with it being unpaved and potholes littering parts of it. To the north, you can see some darker clouds, and closer to Arkit, the weather will get cloudier, and there are more dead trees. The south to north driving direction on this road is worth noting.\n- This section near Arkit has a lot of **snow** everywhere and **low broad leafed trees** all around. This already unique landscape paired with the south to north driving direction makes it very easy to recognise.\n- This section of the M-010 is surrounded by beautiful **spruce covered snowy mountains**. Some snow has also gathered on the sides of the road.\n- This **rocky dirt road** going to Chunkurchak is mostly high up in the snowy hills south of Bishkek. Some of the soil here has a **red tint** to it. On the northern part of the road, you can only see the snowy hills to the south. Also pay attention to the red-and-white bollards on the sides of the roads.\n- There is another road with coverage to the east of the Chunkurchak road: it goes through a very **rocky valley**, with a variety of plants growing on the mountainsides, of which only some have small amounts of snow. You can also see some snow in the valley, and more so towards the south.\n- You can easily recognise this side road, labelled as A367 on the map, from the snow covered mountain ranges in **every** direction. The sun to the south is almost blinding. NOTE: This section of road features the Black Dot Mirror.\n- This divided road north of Bishkek, that leads up to the international airport, uses unique **yellow-and-black curbs** on the median, which consists of mostly grass. Some sections have small planted trees, and poles with red-and-yellow paint on the bottom. The horizontal section west of the airport has a lot more trees.\n- This slightly northeast-bound road north of Bishkek can easily be recognised from the **sunset** coverage.\n- The road south of Jeti Oguz goes through a valley. The general landscape in this valley is **very green** by Kyrgyzstan standards, there are plenty of trees and bushes growing in the valley and on the hills. You can see small patches of snow still on the ground. From most of the valley, you can still see the Tian Shan mountains to the north, and other snowy mountains to the south. The valley also contains these unique orange rock formations.\n- The road north of Grigorievka goes through a stunning river valley. This is one of the most unique roads in Kyrgyzstan. You can easily recognise it from the **spruce covered mountains** in this rocky valley. The lack of snow is also notable. The northern half of this road is on an open rolling field with pine forests scattered around.\n- There is a side road north of the Orto Tokoy Reservoir that has very broken coverage. This road is **well maintained**, and it passes through **dry mountains**. The only vegetation around is grass and shrubs. To the west, you can see this mountain which has little snow left. To the north, the mountains are dark, similar to silhouettes, and on the southern portion of the road, you will see the reservoir.\n- This remote gravel road southwest of Naryn passes through a **dry and desolate valley**. Despite the river, there is nothing but some shrubs on the ground. Many of the mountains in the valley have steep, rocky cliff sides. You will also find snow here, but more so in the south."

In addition, all coverage in Laos was taken by a Generation 3 camera. All five cities have a distinct look and with some practise they are easily distinguishable from each other. The differences are discussed in more detail in the region-guessing section, but the summarized version is as follows: - **Luang Prabang**: historical architecture, hills, palms - **Vang Vieng**: distinct mountains - **Vientiane**: no roof rack, large city - **Savannakhet**: very flat - **Pakse**: red soil, arid, hills\n- In all cities except for the capital, Vientiane, this Google car will be visible. It is silver-coloured, with a **roof rack** with two metal bars and black side mirrors. NOTE: A similar car can be found in Guatemala, so be sure to look at the other clues before guessing.\n- Laos drives on the **right hand** side of the road. NOTE: This is mostly useful to distinguish between Thailand, which drives on the left hand side of the road.\n- Laotian licence plates are short and **yellow**. This distinguishes them from nearby Thailand and Cambodia, who both use white plates on non-commercial vehicles. Laotian commercial plates are white, and government plates are blue. NOTE: Thailand uses yellow plates for commercial vehicles, such as taxis.\n- **Lao script** is compact and curvy, with some diacritics on top and below characters. NOTE: It is very similar to Thai script, but (in most fonts) Lao script has fewer straight lines.\n- Laos is a majority **Buddhist** country. Buddhist temples are a common sight. They can be recognized by their ornate decorations, often with gold leaf detailing. NOTE: Thailand and Cambodia are also majority Buddhist.\n- **Striped curbs** of various colours, such as red, yellow, or black with white, can be seen throughout Laos.\n- **Stop signs** feature the Lao script. Sometimes, the sign features the word ‘stop’ in Latin script below the Lao script. NOTE: In Laos, stop signs only have **2 characters,** compared to 3 in Thailand.\n- Laos uses **square concrete poles**, with small pinholes on the sides in a row from top to bottom. NOTE: Similar poles are found in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and less commonly, Cambodia.\n- Laos uses square concrete **black and white bollards** with one or more black bands. NOTE: Thailand, Indonesia, and rarely Cambodia use similar bollards.\n- Some lamp posts have **diagonal red and white striped markings** that do not** **go down to the base.\n- A **red and white** painted cuboid concrete bollard can sometimes be seen a few metres off the side of the road.\n- Laos has a communist government. You can sometimes see red **hammer and sickle flags**."

                "description": "- Luang Prabang is located on the Mekong River and surrounded by low **mountains** and hills (not always visible).\n- **Palm trees** are common in Luang Prabang.\n- Luang Prabang is the former royal capital of Laos and a UNESCO heritage site. The city has a lot of **historical architecture**, including several temples. Many buildings make use of traditional dark wooden architectural elements. There are also some buildings dating back to French colonial rule of Laos.\n- Within Laos, **blue sign backs** are only found in Luang Prabang.\n- This **rugged mountain range** can be seen from almost any point in Vang Vieng, and is the most reliable way of recognizing it. NOTE: Vang Vieng has very limited coverage; by far the least out of all 5 Lao cities. The actual coverage is also south of the Vang Vieng label on the map.\n- Vang Vieng is also very **touristic**: you will see a lot of signs for hotels, guesthouses, and other tourism-related enterprises. In the (very few) rounds that the distinct mountains are blocked by buildings, this is a good way to recognize the town.\n- As previously mentioned, the Vientiane area is the only part of Laos where the Google car is **not **visible. It also has a considerable amount of rural coverage, especially to its southeast. NOTE: This may lead to toss-ups with Thailand and Cambodia. Use the driving side (Thailand being left, and Laos and Cambodia right), along with other clues to tell them apart.\n- Road 450 east of Vientiane is made entirely of **concrete blocks**. It is also one of the very few divided highways in Laos with coverage.\n- The divided highway that passes through Nong Beuak can be easily recognized by these **street lamps **that line the sides of the road. NOTE: These streetlamps can also be found on the divided section of road 13, but it is more urban, and has a different road angle.\n- The road that goes through the conservation area features uniquely **hilly **terrain for Laos. Landscape around the road is also very **dry**, and mostly **forested**. Additionally, the road is in good condition with coloured curbs and dashed outer lines. NOTE: It is the only single lane road that has black and white or yellow and white curbs.\n- The only trekker in Laos is a view of the monumental **Patuxai** arch, a massive war memorial in the middle of Vientiane. Some of the coverage is made with a normal trekker, and some with a tripod.\n- Savannakhet is very **flat**: the only mountains that are visible are on the other side of the Mekong river, in Thailand. It is also recognizable as its soil has a **slight red** tinge, however not as red as Pakse. NOTE: On Google Maps, the label for Savannakhet is hidden under the label of the Thai province of Mukdahan until you zoom in relatively close. You can find Savannakhet by going west of Xeno.\n- The southern city of Pakse is easily recognizable thanks to the distinct **red **soil. The vegetation is also uniquely **dry**, with equally dry hills nearby.\n- This 1380-metre long **bridge **crosses the Mekong River next to the city of Pakse. It is the only major bridge in Laos with coverage."

Bollards often have numbers below the front reflector. NOTE: Estonian and Lithuanian bollards look different. This infographic shows the main similarities and differences between the bollards of the Baltic and Nordic countries.\n- Latvian poles have distinctive poletops, with **hook-shaped insulators**, that are arranged in an alternating manner: left-right-left (or vice versa). NOTE: These poletops are much more rare in the other two Baltic countries. They can however appear in some other European countries.\n- Latvia uses white chevrons with red arrows. NOTE: Many other European countries, including Lithuania and Poland, use the same chevrons. However, Estonia, Russia and Ukraine use chevrons with the opposite colour scheme: red with white arrows.\n- All Baltic countries use the same blue kilometre marker. However, they can be distinguished from each other by their angle relative to the road. In Latvia, the marker will be **parallel** to the road. It only has a number on one side. For a quick overview of all three Baltic countries, see this infographic.\n- Each Baltic country has a slightly different border for its warning and speed signs. Latvian signs have a **thick** red border, with a **thin white outline** around it.\n- Latvian pedestrian signs have **five stripes**, which is unique within the Baltics. Uniquely, the pedestrian has noticeably **long legs** compared to pedestrian signs in other European countries. The other two Baltic countries have three stripes on their pedestrian signs.\n- Latvian bus stop signs have this design. Most importantly, the bus has **five windows**. Within the Baltics, this is unique to Latvia. The other two Baltic countries have four windows.\n- Latvia has normal A-type guardrails with **white or red reflectors**. NOTE: Estonia has no reflectors. Lithuania has orange reflectors. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- **Latvian** belongs to the Baltic languages. The other major member of this branch is Lithuanian, to which it is closely related. Within the Baltic languages, the following letters are unique to Latvian: - Vowels with a macron (horizontal stripe): Ā Ē Ī. - Consonants with a small hook: Ģ Ķ Ļ Ņ. NOTE: Estonian is not a member of the Baltic languages(despite the name), and therefore looks significantly different.\n- The Latvian word for street is **iela**. This word is unique to Latvian. Very rarely, you might see ‘gatve’ in Riga (abbreviated as gat.). This word is also the standard word for street in Lithuania (usually abbreviated as g.).\n- Latvian house numbers are often shaped like **tall rectangles** and can be found in several colours. NOTE: This is not common in Estonia or Lithuania.\n- Latvian architecture generally consists of a combination of **wood** and **white brick**, typically with somewhat steep **corrugated metal roofs**. Slightly modern houses with **pastel coloured stone walls** and houses with a combination of wood with another material, particularly white brick, are also common.\n- Latvian directional signs are blue with white text. NOTE: The arrow on Latvian signs is more stylized than in Estonia and Lithuania, where the back part of the arrowhead is vertical.\n- A red generation 4 Google car can be found in Latvia. NOTE: It can also be found in a few other European countries, including Lithuania, but not Estonia.\n- A black generation 4 Google car can also be found in Latvia.

While Botswana and Eswatini only have Generation 3 coverage, South Africa also has Generation 2 and Generation 4 coverage. In addition, Generation 3 coverage is somewhat rare in South Africa.\n- One of the best ways to identify the country are the characteristic ‘**Lesotho mountains**’. They are bare and treeless, often have tabletop-like shapes, and recognizable horizontal rocky ridgelines. Depending on where you are in the country, the mountains can vary a bit in appearance. Especially inland areas towards the southeast, where they appear more like rolling green hills rather than isolated tabletop mountains. However, you will still often be able to see the horizontal rocky ridges.\n- Lesotho uses long white licence plates with **blue** text. If partially unblurred, you may see the Mokorotlo hat symbol on the left.\n- Lesotho uses **yellow outer lines** and white inner lines. NOTE: These are also found in the other three southern African countries.\n- Some roads have unique **triple middle lines**, consisting of two solid lines with a dashed line in between.

In the **flat region**, the road itself runs through a mostly flat or hilly landscape. “Flat” is a bit of a misnomer, as you will usually still see tabletop-like mountains around you. However they will usually be significantly further away from the road, giving you a more clear line of sight. This “flat” part is the region with the most coverage, settlements and agriculture.\n- Conversely, in the **mountainous part**, the road will usually be directly on the side of the mountain, instead of slightly away from it. The mountains are often large, closer to the road, and covered in green grass.

As a result, you will often see a sort of temporary “bollard” next to the road, consisting of a **stick** that is mostly painted** white**. Even on sections without the bollard, you can often recognize this road, as it is a wide dirt road with very dark brown soil.\n- The road going from Ramatsediso to **Sehlabathebe NP**, in the southeast on the border with South Africa, is very recognizable. Consider guessing there if the following three things are all true for your location: - Unpaved road with light brown soil. - Good weather with little fluffy clouds. - Grassy landscape high in the mountains. You will also often be able to see exposed, light-coloured rocks next to the road.\n- The only city with a significantly **urbanised downtown** area is Maseru, the capital.

The rest of Liechtenstein is either very flat or in the mountains.\n- In the flat area west of Balzers, with the northeast-oriented gridded roads, to the North/Northwest, you can often see two rocky peaks on the Swiss side.\n- Unlike the rest of Liechtenstein, Vaduz sometimes uses **red bus stop signs.** NOTE: ** **Regular bus stops are also present.\n- Unlike the rest of Liechtenstein, Balzers sometimes uses **black bus stop signs.** NOTE: ** **Regular bus stops are also present.\n- Blue street signs with a thin white border will place you either in the south of Liechtenstein or in the north around Bandern.\n- Blue street signs that don’t have an outline are found in Eschen.\n- Flat black signs are found in eastern Liechtenstein.\n- Black signs with a white border and embossed letters can be found in Schaan.\n- These brown street signs with a font reminiscent of **traditional German typefaces**, along with a white border, are found in Vaduz and the northern towns.\n- Brown street signs that have an **arrow design** are unique to Ruggell. NOTE: The regular brown signs are also present in Ruggell.\n- Browns signs which have a more ‘generic’ font will place you in Planken."

They have an orange reflector on the front, and a white reflector on the back. Both reflectors are rectangular. You may find this thin version as well. NOTE: Estonian and Latvian bollards look different. This infographic shows the main similarities and differences between the bollards of the Baltic and Nordic countries.\n- Lithuanian poles are usually square and concrete, and often feature a **diagonal support beam**. NOTE: While most common in Lithuania, these are also found from time to time in Estonia, and on rare occasions in Latvia.\n- Pictured here are some typical Lithuanian poletops. - They often have **short horizontal rods**, on which the insulators are placed. - In some poletops, the insulators are arranged in a **trident-like shape**, with one on top, and two on each side. Note that these poletops are not unique to Lithuania: they can also be found in the other post-Soviet countries.\n- Lithuania uses **white chevrons with red arrows**. The small single chevrons (pictured here) usually have a **red outline** on the edge of the sign. NOTE: Many other European countries, including Latvia and Poland, use the same chevrons (though without the red outline). However, Estonia, Russia and Ukraine use chevrons with the opposite colour scheme: red with white arrows.\n- All Baltic countries use the same blue kilometre marker. However, they can be distinguished from each other by their angle relative to the road. In Lithuania, the marker will be at a **45° angle** towards the road. The sign itself has an L-shape. For a quick overview of all three Baltic countries, see this infographic.\n- Each Baltic country has a slightly different border for its warning and speed signs. Lithuanian signs have a relatively **thin** red border, with a **thin white outline** around it.\n- Lithuania has normal A-type guardrails with **orange reflectors**. NOTE: Estonia has no reflectors. Latvia has red or white reflectors. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- Lithuanian pedestrian signs have **3 stripes**. The shape of the pedestrian has a relatively low level of detail. NOTE: Both Russia and Ukraine share the same design.** **Estonian signs also have 3 stripes, but the pedestrian looks more detailed. Latvian pedestrian signs have 5 stripes.\n- Lithuanian bus stop signs have this design. The bus has **four windows**. This is mostly useful to distinguish it from the Latvian bus stop sign, which has five windows. Note however, that Estonia has the same bus stop signs as Lithuania.\n- **Lithuanian** belongs to the Baltic languages. The other major member of this branch is Latvian, to which it is closely related. Within the Baltic languages, the following letters are unique to Lithuanian: - Vowels with small hooks: Ą Ę Į Ų. - Ė with a single dot. - Y (also in Estonian, but only in loan words). NOTE: Estonian is not a member of the Baltic languages (despite its name), and therefore looks significantly different.\n- The Lithuanian word for street is **gatve**, often abbreviated as **g.** on signs and Google Maps. This word is almost entirely unique to Lithuanian. However, very rarely, you might see ‘gatve’ (abbreviated as gat.) in the Latvian capital of Riga.\n- Many Lithuanian place names end in **-ai**.\n- Lithuanian architecture primarily consists of light coloured brick buildings, usually with somewhat steep corrugated metal roofs. Wooden buildings are also fairly common, however less so than in Estonia. Pastel painted stone buildings are somewhat common, especially in newer suburbs.\n- Lithuanian directional signs are blue with white text. NOTE: The arrow on Latvian signs is more stylized than in Estonia and Lithuania, where the back part of the arrowhead is vertical.\n- Lithuania's **historical state flag**, known as the _Vytis_, depicts a mounted knight on a dark red background. It can sometimes be seen on both private and public buildings.\n- Lithuania has **less forest cover** than the other two Baltic countries. As a result, the landscape appears more open and agricultural. Your mileage may vary depending on the round however, so use this meta with some caution.\n- In Generation 3 coverage, you will often see **random small blurs**. These blurs look similar to the ones that are used to blur out licence plates or faces, but instead they cover seemingly random parts of the image – often on direction signs. NOTE: This is also common in the Russian oblast of Kaliningrad, just to the southwest of Lithuania. These random blurs are not typically found in Estonia or Latvia.\n- A black generation 4 Google car can be found in Lithuania. NOTE: It can also be found in a few other European countries, including Latvia, but not Estonia.\n- A red generation 4 Google car can also be found in Lithuania. NOTE: It can also be found in a few other European countries, including Latvia, but not Estonia."

The road is surrounded on all sides by forest with many Baltic pines. In many places, you will see slightly windswept trees (visible in the example image).\n- On the Curonian Spit you can also find wooden, and often red, **Scandinavian looking houses**.\n- Rarely, you can see bilingual signs with **Polish language** in a small area southeast of Lithuania.

                "description": "- Luxembourg uses **long** **yellow** plates with a blue strip on the left. Since Luxembourg is a small country, foreign cars with white plates are somewhat common. NOTE: There are only a few other European countries that use yellow plates for private vehicles: - The Netherlands has yellow plates front and rear. - The UK has yellow rear plates. - Some pre-2009 French cars have yellow rear plates.\n- **Bollards** are black and white. They are wedge-shaped and have grey reflectors. Some have a distinctive indent in the lower half. NOTE: They look more or less identical to German bollards. The most notable difference is that the reflectors on German bollards have two bolts, while in Luxembourg they have three. The bollards of Belgium, the Netherlands and France look very different.\n- Chevrons are **black with yellow** arrows. You may also rarely come across blue and yellow chevrons. NOTE: None of Luxembourg’s neighbours use these chevrons. The only other European countries with this colour scheme tend to have wildly different landscapes: Iceland, Norway, Finland, Ireland, and Portugal.\n- Poles with poletops shaped like **upside-down tridents** are the most common type of pole in Luxembourg. In addition, you can find a variety of other poletops. NOTE: These poles can also be commonly seen in France, Spain and Portugal.\n- Almost all coverage in Luxembourg is either **Generation 2 or Generation 4**. Generation 3 is rare, but does exist.\n- Luxembourg is a highly **multilingual country**. It has three administrative languages: Luxembourgish, French, and German. French is the language that is mostly used for public communication. Road signs and advertisements are usually in French. Presence of German on signs is less common compared to French, but certainly not non-existent.\n- **Luxembourgish** is closely related to German and can look very similar. Like German, it uses umlauts (dots over vowels). In addition, it uses a fair amount of double vowels, and sometimes an é with an accent. Most town names have their origin in Luxembourgish, German, or both.\n- **Directional signs **are yellow with a thin black outline. Town names are written in uppercase. The signs have a pointed tip. They are completely surrounded by a **frame**, making them very recognizable. Some directional signs feature road numbers: - Regional road numbers have 1 or 2 digits and a red box. - Local road numbers have 3 digits and a yellow box.\n- **Town entrance signs **are also yellow and surrounded by a frame. Most of these signs have bilingual versions of the town name. They frequently have the road number on the top, along with a speed limit sign.\n- The **frames **mentioned in the previous two tips are also commonly found on a lot of other road infrastructure. NOTE: Denmark notably also uses a lot of similar-looking frames on road infrastructure. A recognizable difference is that the corners on Luxembourg frames are more square, while Danish frames are more rounded.\n- Almost all Luxembourgish road signs will be supported by a **white signpost**. NOTE: While not nearly as common, white signposts are also found in France.\n- **Street signs** are almost always short and usually have a white background. The exact designs vary from town to town. A very common design is the one pictured on the left in the example image, with slanted blue corners. NOTE: Belgian street signs often appear short as well, but can have other background colours – not just white. In addition, Dutch street signs almost always have a blue background and tend to be much longer than they are tall.\n- Some signposts have this bulky, round reflector with **blue and white** markings. NOTE: Similar markings are found in Sweden and Finland. Landscape should be sufficient to tell these apart from Luxembourg, however.\n- **Pedestrian signs** have 5 vertical stripes. NOTE: Belgian pedestrian signs have 2 horizontal stripes.\n- **Bus stop signs** are blue and always have this exact design. The bus has six windows. NOTE: Bus stop signs in Belgium and the Netherlands have significantly different designs. For example, the Belgian bus stop sign always has a yellow signpost.\n- Almost all of Luxembourg’s landscape consists of green **rolling hills**, with a patchwork of agriculture and forests. NOTE: If you see a yellow licence plate, and you are not sure what country it belongs to, landscape is often a good clue: almost all of the Netherlands is completely flat.\n- Houses tend to have **dark slate roofs**. Walls and windows tend to be plain and undecorated. Walls are usually painted white, grey, or pastel colours. NOTE: Such architecture can also be found in the surrounding regions in Belgium and France, but is especially prominent in Luxembourg."

The coverage in Macau specifically is some of the oldest Generation 2 available, meaning that the colours look even more **washed out** and overexposed than usual.

Licence plates can either be long or square.\n- Cylindrical grey lamp posts with a **black painted bottom** can be seen in Macau. NOTE: Similar lamp posts can be seen in Hong Kong, however they do not have a black painted bottom.\n- Due to Macau’s history as a Portuguese colony, **Portuguese language** can commonly be seen, especially on storefronts, along with Chinese.\n- These **white** street signs with a **blue border** around the Chinese and Portuguese text are unique to Macau.\n- **Gambling** is legal in Macau and its biggest source of revenue (50% of its GDP).

It is worth noting that almost all the coverage was taken using trekkers, with only two exceptions, both of which have a visible, unique Street View car. Because of the limited coverage, this guide will be structured differently than most other guides. It will be divided into two main sections: one for **land coverage** and one for **boat coverage**, which in turn is divided into subsections based on region.\n- The coverage in Ambanja can be recognized by a person wearing a **dark blue T-shirt** and black sunglasses.\n- The coverage on the island of Nosy Ambariovato can be recognized by the **people**, one wearing a blue T-shirt and sunglasses on their forehead, one with a light red T-shirt and one with a darker red tank top. There is also a fourth person in some of the coverage, wearing a light blue T-shirt. The coverage is very hilly and forested.\n- There is a **village** by the northern shore of Nosy Ambariovato.\n- Ambiky can be recognized by the large number of **palms** combined with the **brown**, sandy dirt road. In most of the coverage, there is a person walking in front of the trekker with a grey T-shirt and a brown backpack.\n- A beach west of Ambiky can be recognized by the **low trees** combined with low mountains to the northwest.\n- An area with coverage south of Ambiky can be recognized by the large, solitary **green bushes** combined with a very slight red tinge in the dirt. Certain parts of the coverage are quite wet.\n- There are three major sections of coverage along the Sambirano river, most of which can be identified with the single person, wearing a **dark blue** T-shirt and **sunglasses** on their forehead. The same person is also present on Nosy Ambariovato.\n- A small section of the coverage by the Sambirano river has two **different people** present on the coverage; one with a red T-shirt and white cap, and one with a spotted dress.\n- A couple of atolls on the central west coast can be seen on Street View. The northernmost is the smallest, and is easily recognizable as it only consists of **sand** and you can always see from one shore to the other. NOTE: Among the five atolls with land coverage, only the two furthest south appear on the map.\n- The other atolls can be recognized by their small size relative to other landmasses and the **broad leaved palms** which is rarely found anywhere else in the country.\n- Most of the coverage in Antananarivo was taken on the **side of a hill** looking out over the city, which leads up to the Queen’s Palace, which can be seen near the top of the hill.\n- The coverage on the RN8 between Andriamena and Marofandilia can easily be recognized by the large **silver roof rack** on the Street View car. The coverage is very dry and sandy.\n- The trekker next to the RN8 can be recognized by its extreme dryness, combined with the **four people** wearing red, blue, grey and light blue respectively.\n- Baobab Avenue is easy to recognize by the extremely **broad trunked** baobab trees along the side of the road.\n- Morondava is most easily recognized by the bald person wearing either a light green or a light red striped shirt. It is also one of few towns where the trekker walks on a paved road.\n- Morondava has a very **smooth sand beach**, with the ocean to the northwest. There are a large number of palms visible.\n- Belo Sur Mer can be recognized by the large number of palms combined with the blanket of **white sand **on the ground.\n- The beach outside Belo Sur Mer can be recognized by the somewhat **dirty sand** and the curved shoreline with the ocean to the northwest.\n- Kirindy Mitea National Park can be most easily recognized by having the **reddest soil** present on Street View in Madagascar.\n- A car with a barely visible **grey metal roof rack** can be seen by Manahy. There are some locations where the car is completely blurred out, where the shape of the blur is the best indication of the area.\n- A piece of coverage, partly taken on a large **grassy field**, and partly on the side of a **sand dune**, can be found south of Manahy.\n- A village with the shore to the **east** can be found north of Andavadoaka.\n- A small, very sandy village with the shore to the **north** can be seen on a small cape north of Andavadoaka. Part of the coverage was taken just outside the shoreline.\n- The town of Andavadoaka can be recognized by **three** different people appearing on the coverage; One wearing a greyish hat and a light blue shirt, and two with red and white T-shirts.\n- The main part of the trekker coverage surrounding Andavadoaka can be recognized by either the person wearing a greyish hat and light blue shirt or a person wearing a** **yellow T-shirt.\n- A second Trekker, going to the northeast of Andavadoaka can be recognized by a person with a **light blue T-shirt**.\n- A blue cart dragged by a **black **cow on the left and a **brown-white **cow on the right can be found south of Andavadoaka.\n- Another cart dragged by a **white** cow on the left and a **black and white cow** on the right can be found just south of Andavadoaka.\n- A small seaside village, with little to **no visible people** can be found in the northern end of the bay, south of Andavadoaka.\n- Coverage on a somewhat **rocky** ground with **no people** following the trekker can be found southwest of the bay.\n- Coverage with multiple different people walking near and around the trekker, and with a small village to the west, can be found in the southeastern part of the bay. Part of the coverage goes through a very shallow body of water.\n- A cluster of **fishing nets** can be found in the bay.\n- The Tsaranoro Massif is a large **monolithic mountain** with trekker coverage. The steep mountainsides, combined with the mountainous area surrounding the coverage makes it very recognizable. The four people following the trekker can also occasionally be a useful clue.\n- A small part of the coverage in Tsaranoro was taken inside a forest, which occasionally hides the surrounding mountains. The best way to recognize this area is the relatively **dark coverage**, combined with the four people following the trekker.\n- A **small settlement** is found in the northeastern end of Tsaranoro. The mountains can typically be seen in the background.\n- Toliara can be recognized as being a generally quite busy-looking town and the only large town on Madagascar with **no person** following the trekker.\n- Two pieces of coverage can be recognized by two people following the trekker; one with a **yellow tank top** and one with a **blue T-shirt**. The first of these two parts is located in the town of St Augustin.\n- The second part with the same two people is found to the east of St Augustin, going through a **hilly landscape** with a lot of shrubs."

NOTE: The Azores do not commonly have eucalypti.\n- **Hydrangeas** can occasionally be seen. NOTE: They are even more common on the Azores.\n- African lilies (Agapanthus praecox) are very common in Madeira. They can be recognized by their long grassy leaves and round flower clusters at the end of a long stem. The most common colours are white and blue.\n- Due to the lack of flat terrain, **terrace farming** is extensively practised on the island. Stone walls are used to separate the individual plateaus.\n- **Ferns** are very common throughout the island.\n- Houses are mainly painted white, grey, or pastel colours such as yellow and pink. In addition, the red tile roofs will often be in a good condition.\n- **Concrete block barriers**, usually painted white, are often found along roads.\n- Bus stops signs on Madeira follow a unique **black, white **and** yellow** colour scheme.\n- Taxis on Madeira are yellow with a blue stripe running along the sides of the car.\n- Madeira commonly uses small and unique stone bollards with a red reflector. They are either cuboidal or cylindrical in shape.\n- Madeira sometimes uses yellow-and black guardrails on its mountain roads.\n- These speed limit signs are unique to Madeira and can be found on its highways.\n- **Low altitude **clouds are typical on the island, and are often seen on street view.\n- **Foggy coverage** is quite common.\n- As a result of the island’s mountainous terrain, **tunnels** are very common.\n- On bridges you will often find railings painted **dark green**.\n- Signposts on Madeira are often striped. NOTE: These are also seen on the Azores.\n- You can sometimes find **free roaming cows** on high-altitude roads on the island, as well as warning signs for those cows. The cows will typically be brown with white spots, contrary to the Azores, where the cows will typically be black and white.\n- Google used a weird, low-quality camera on Madeira, commonly known as the official Ari (or \"shitcam\"). It has a wide circular car blur and makes the image appear rather gloomy. On Madeira, you will often see the unblurred back of a **white** car.

Instead of learning a lot of country-specific clues, it is more practical to simply memorise what the trekkers look like.\n- All this trekker coverage is made with a regular consumer-grade camera on a **tripod**. This gives all the coverage a very peculiar and recognizable look, which is different from the normal backpack trekkers. It can have a slightly ‘ethereal’ look to it, but it is recommended to simply click on a few of the locations to get a feeling for what it looks like. Objects in the image will usually have motion blur, and slightly saturated colours. From here on, the Mali tripod trekkers will be simply referred to as “tripods”. NOTE: Tripods can also be found in several other countries.\n- Almost all the tripods focus on showing **historical mosques**. These tripods usually have an indoor part and an exterior part, which are sometimes not connected to each other. These mosques have a recognizable look: they are made out of **mud bricks and adobe plaster**. The walls of the buildings are decorated with wooden sticks. Inside, you will usually see the same adobe walls, and prayer rugs on the floor.\n- The exterior parts of the mosque tripods can look like a normal street. These will sometimes have enough information available (when moving) to be included in **pinpointable maps**, like A Community World. This guide has separate sections for the pinpointable and non-pinpointable coverage. You can choose to study only the coverage that is relevant for competitive maps, or all the coverage. Note, however, that the interiors of the mosques are not considered pinpointable, even though they are covered in the section next to their respective exteriors.\n- Mali is generally an **arid** country. Seeing a sandy, dry landscape can help with immediately distinguishing the Mali tripods from most tripods in other countries."

The interior’s light blue walls and pink floor make this location instantly recognizable. The coverage on the exterior is in the mosque’s yard. The outside walls are made of concrete, and are painted yellow and orange. This coverage is **severely misplaced**, being actually located in an unidentifiable rural area, rather than inside Bamako.\n- This natural **rocky gorge **is part of the Bandiagara Escarpment.

                "description": "- Mongolian licence plates are mostly white with a hint of **red** on the left side from the Soyombo symbol.\n- Mongolia primarily uses **Cyrillic **script, though Latin and traditional Mongolian script can also occasionally be seen. Mongolian Cyrillic contains the letters **Ɵ** and **Ү**,** **which do not exist in the Russian alphabet. Additionally, the use of **double vowels**,** **such as aa, ƟƟ or ЭЭ, is common in Mongolian. NOTE: The letters **Ɵ** and **Ү **also exist in the Kyrgyz and Kazakh languages.\n- Mongolia very often has a visible Street View car as all of Mongolian coverage was driven with a large pickup truck. The truck can have several features such as a **tent **on top, **red** **side-view mirrors**, a **snorkel,** and **roof-racks.** All of these can be of help in identifying Mongolia.\n- Mongolia can typically be identified by the **steppe biomes** found across the country. While some forested areas are found in Mongolia, most of the country features empty grasslands or deserts with a characteristic **lack of trees**. It is not uncommon to find rugged, rocky or rolling hills as well as rivers and lakes across Mongolia.\n- Mongolia uniquely features white **bowling-pin shaped bollards** with two red stripes around the top.\n- Mongolian infrastructure has clear Russian influence. Wooden poles with supporting stone blocks, white lamp posts, and three-striped** **pedestrian crossing signs are common to see. Unique to Mongolia is the** ****“ЗОГС”**** stop sign**. NOTE: Each town has unique lamp post designs, so learning them can be quite useful.\n- Mongolian neighbourhoods are very frequently separated by **dirt alleys **and wooden fences.\n- White, round **yurts** are the traditional dwelling of nomadic families in Mongolia, and are often seen all around the country.\n- It is very common to see** **large **herds of animals** in Mongolia, including horses, yaks, cows, sheep, goats, and camels.\n- Decorated piles of stones, known as **ovoos**, are used as ceremonial markers or shrines throughout Mongolia and are common to see."

                "description": "- Mongolia has very **limited coverage**, mainly along highways and in large towns. Learning which roads and towns have coverage can be very useful. The highest coverage density can be found around the capital of Ulaanbaatar. NOTE: Mongolia has lots of hidden coverage that will generally not be discussed in the guide. _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- Driving directions can be a very useful clue for narrowing down your location in Mongolia. In general, the driving direction tends to be **away** from Ulaanbaatar. _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- Mongolia has a very flat landscape in the east and in the south, with rolling hills in the north, and large mountains and rocky hills being common in the west. _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- You can find **forests**, typically surrounded by grassy fields, all around northern Mongolia. Generally these will be Siberian Larches, with pines and birches being common as well.\n- Small dirt tracks within flat, **vast grassy fields** are mainly found in far eastern Mongolia.\n- There are several areas with off-road **desert **coverage in southern Mongolia. Most of this coverage is directly south or east of the town of Mandalgovi.\n- There are a couple of **paved desert roads** in southern Mongolia. _You can learn more about these roads later in the guide._\n- You can find arid steppe rangeland, characterised by the **coarse soil**, **patchy grass**, and** small shrubs**, throughout southwestern Mongolia.\n- These **dry**, **rugged hills and mountains** are common to see in far western Mongolia.\n- Lakes and rivers are much more common in western Mongolia.\n- **Snow **coverage is mostly found around Ulaanbaatar.\n- Fall coverage in Mongolia gives rise to very distinct **orange-coloured trees and grass**, and can only be found in a few areas; mostly between the towns of Lun and Hatgal, with some fall coverage around Ulaanbaatar. Trees are more commonly seen the further north you are. NOTE: Some of the generation 4 coverage in Ulaanbaatar was also taken in the fall.\n- Around the town of Bugant is a large forest that stands out for having **narrow dirt trails** with** close trees**, typically on both sides, in a way that can appear quite Russian. Additionally, it is very common to see birches around this area. Keep in mind that the dirt trails in this forest do not appear on the map.\n- Due to Mongolia’s harsh climate and terrain, **crop fields** are rare, but they do occasionally appear in the subdivisions of Selenge and Töv,** **near Ulaanbaatar.\n- The capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is by far the biggest city in Mongolia, with about 50% of the entire country's population living in it. As such, its urban development and sheer size is unlike anywhere else in Mongolia. The cityscape is bustling with many **high rise buildings**, chain stores, travelling cars, buses, and pedestrians, as well as clean roads and sidewalks. Meanwhile, the suburbs can be recognized from the vast yurt districts in **hilly areas**. Generation 4 coverage is common, however Generation 3 winter coverage is also common to see in the suburbs.\n- The Choir Highway is the longest covered paved road in Mongolia, running from Nalaikh down to Zamiin-Uud on the Chinese border, and is **mostly desert**. The dry brown soil, lack of vegetation, clear skies, and general flatness are all characteristic of this road. Additionally, a railroad runs along the entire highway, which can be seen **west **of the highway north of Sainshand, and **east **of the highway south of Sainshand. Between the towns of Sainshand and Erdene there is some overcast coverage.\n- The other main desert highway in Mongolia runs through Mandalgovi, and can be differentiated from the Choir Highway by its **cloudy skies**, darker pavement, and deep blue tent instead of the tentless car.\n- The Mandalgovi Highway runs south of the capital and was covered during a blizzard, making it **extremely snowy and foggy.** It also has a deep blue tent, which is found along this entire road, and a flat landscape which can differentiate it from other snowy roads.\n- The Millenium Road runs just west of the town of Lun, and has **late fall coverage**, combined with a dry climate that gives it characteristic **orange short grass**. The silver tent, clear skies, and general flatness with low rolling hills also help in identifying this road. The sun gradually sets as the car continues west until it becomes sunset at the end of the road. NOTE: At the end of the road, the car continues travelling northwest up to Murun on off-road dirt trails.\n- The Darkhan-Erdenet highway can be identified by the low rolling hills, tall **transmission towers**, and occasional crop fields in the area. Additionally, most of the highway has **winter coverage** with the tentless car, light snow, and yellow grass. Beware that summer coverage can occasionally appear in the eastern half of the road.\n- The highway connecting the towns of Chinggis and Baruun-Urt stands out as one of the only **paved highways in the east**. It is considerably cloudy and the road seems freshly paved, making it a **very dark road**, combined with a mostly flat landscape.\n- A **railroad** can be seen along almost the entire road to the town of Khuder in the north. It is usually very close to the road, but can occasionally be quite far away, in which case it can still be identified by the mound it is built upon. In the western half of this road, the river to the south can also be seen. Keep in mind that this railroad does not appear on the map.\n- While there are many unique Street View cars in Mongolia, for the sake of brevity, this guide only covers the most high-yield car metas. Car meta is very useful for Mongolia, however it is certainly possible to learn Mongolia without relying on cars. Roads highlighted in red will **only** have that car, while roads highlighted in pink can have **more than one** car. Roads in grey are hidden coverage.\n- The roof racks of the Street View car are very useful as they can effectively split Mongolia in half. The presence of **rubber inlays** in the roof racks are generally found in the **west**, while **empty roof racks** are generally found in the **east**. _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- You can split Mongolia into 4 zones based on the **spare tire** in the back right of the Street View car: - A netted spare tire shown in red - A single strap spare tire shown in green - A spare tire with no strap shown in orange - Without a spare tire shown in blue _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- In the eastern grasslands, the Street View car has a **light blue tent** and a forward-facing snorkel.\n- The eastern region can be further divided into several smaller areas based on the layout of the **orange** **roof rack straps**. These straps can be seen by looking straight down. NOTE: Orange straps can be found in the west as well, this tip is only useful for the eastern car with a blue tent from the previous tip. _You can click on the map to enlarge it._\n- The tent will have **red tensioner straps** at the front around the city of Chinggis. NOTE: The Chinggis-Baganuur highway (in grey) is almost entirely hidden coverage.\n- North of Ulaanbaatar you can find this car, which has the same blue tent as the eastern tent, but with a **backwards-facing snorkel**. The snorkel can sometimes be difficult to see, so use other additional clues such as rolling hills and forests to confirm the region. NOTE: The highway in pink can have either the blue tent car or the tentless car with snow coverage.\n- A Street View car with **no tent** can be seen in and around the capital city. It is generally found on a **northwest diagonal** going through Ulaanbaatar. Southeast of Ulaanbaatar, on the Choir highway, the car will have a double mirror on the left as well as a backward facing snorkel. Driving direction is especially useful with this car as it is always travelling away from the capital.\n- A Street View car with a **bright silver tent** is generally found in **central and northwestern** Mongolia. NOTE: The Bulgan Highway (in grey) is almost entirely hidden coverage.\n- A Street View car with a **grey tent** and **hooks **on the tent can only be found in western Mongolia. It is the most common car to have the netted spare tire.\n- If the grey tent has **hook straps** **angled downwards**, you should be in southwestern Mongolia.\n- If the grey tent has **no hooks** on the left side and is **billowing **from the wind, you will be on the road between Khovd and Ölgii or around the town of Tugrug.\n- A Street View car with a **cage** on top of the roof instead of a tent can be seen near Ulaanbaatar. West of Ulaanbaatar, the car will have a green camouflage sleeping bag on top of the cage (coverage highlighted in green). Additionally, all coverage with this car was taken during winter, with most of it being in snowy areas. NOTE: The cage car can very rarely appear in Kharkhorin and Zuunmod.\n- Generation 4 coverage in the capital uses a** **silver truck with an **ornate blue & white** **roof decal**, with a snorkel and long antenna on the front right. While the unique roof can be seen in most locations, some locations blur most of the car, leaving only the snorkel and antenna visible. This car can only be found **around Ulaanbaatar**.\n- Generation 4 coverage in **eastern Mongolia** uses a silver pick-up truck with a large **metal box **and shovel on the roof. The car was sponsored by Bodi Group, however camera stitching generally hides one of the letters.\n- Generation 4 coverage in **western Mongolia** uses a **silver pick-up truck** with a big light blue tent. Different variations of the tent can be useful for narrowing down the region.\n- The tent with 2 straps and a **single knot** in the straps covers most of northwestern Mongolia. NOTE: Occasionally, camera stitching can hide the knot.\n- The tent with a **knot on both straps** covers most of southwestern Mongolia.\n- The tent with the **lower strap in a clump **covers most of central-southern Mongolia, along the road from Ulaanbaatar to Altai.\n- The tent with **4 straps** covers most of central-northern Mongolia.\n- You can find a tent with an **open zipper** in central Mongolia, near the town of Khorgo."

                "description": "- Erdenet is the second largest city in Mongolia. As such, it has many multistory buildings that can be seen from across town, a large stadium, and a **ferris wheel** in the south of the city. It is surrounded by large barren hills to the south and to the north, and was covered on a **cloudy day **in the** winter**, meaning all vegetation is dead. NOTE: Erdenet can look very similar to Darkhan and Ulaanbaatar, but the lack of snow distinguishes it from Darkhan, while the cloudy skies and lack of rubber inlays on the roof racks can be used to distinguish it from Ulaanbaatar.\n- The city of Darkhan in northern Mongolia can be recognized by its distinct **snow coverage**. It is the third largest city in Mongolia and as such has many high-rising buildings and travelling cars. NOTE: Other smaller towns can also have snow coverage but Darkhan is the only large city in Mongolia with snow coverage, apart from some Ulaanbaatar suburbs.\n- Sukhbaatar and Altanbulag are two neighbouring towns in the north near the Russian border. They have dry, forested hills all around and heavy **overcast coverage**. Sukhbaatar is completely overcast while Altanbulag is slightly less cloudy. NOTE: Murun and Choibalsan are two other towns that also have overcast coverage, but lack forested hills and have different Street View cars.\n- Chinggis is a major town in the east with **red straps** on the front of the tent. It is a fairly dry and flat town with small hills to the north, and somewhat cloudy skies. NOTE: Dundburd and Bayan-Ovoo are the only other towns with the same tent, but are much smaller towns with no paved roads.\n- Choibalsan is the only major city to have several **concrete roads**. In most parts of the city there is a visible **smoke stack**, which is in the southeast corner of the city. It appears to have just rained as the roads are slightly wet and the sky is overcast. Additionally, you may occasionally find unique pedestrian signs with a short figure over three stripes.\n- Baruun-Urt can be identified by the** towering building under construction** in the centre of town (on the map its POI is called “Smile”) combined with the dry landscape. NOTE: Similar buildings under construction can be found in other towns such as Chinggis but they are not as large and do not feature an** **orange tower crane like the Smile building.\n- The town of Khalkhgol in far east Mongolia can be recognized by its flat, green landscape with low rolling hills and a **giant sword statue** visible in the distance.\n- The town of Dariganga can be recognized by the **distinctive hill** present to the northwest of the town in an otherwise flat landscape.\n- Sainshand is the largest town in the desert region and it has a dry climate, many buildings, and paved roads. A **dry ridge** separates the northern and southern parts of the town, distinguishing Sainshand from other desert towns that are mostly flat. In the downtown area you can find a miniature pink eiffel tower.\n- The desert town of Zamiin-Uud on the border with China has unique **sailboat lamp posts **featuring a** golden flower pot** around them. Often, white signs with Mongolian folded script can be seen attached to these lamp posts. NOTE: The other desert towns of Choir and Sainshand look similar to Zamiin-Uud and have the same Street View car but use different lamp posts. Choir can be identified by its blue lamp posts and Sainshand by its white lamp posts.\n- Mandalgovi is a large desert town with notably **cloudy coverage**. It’s the only large desert town apart from Dalanzadgad which is not on the Choir Highway, and it has a **deep blue tent** instead of the tentless car.\n- Dalanzadgad can be easily recognised by its distinct **sunset coverage**. Additionally it has a dry climate, fall-coloured grass, rocky hills to the south, some smoke stacks, and a unique **loose tent cover** on the left side.\n- Arvaikheer is a large central town recognizable by the **warm, green, and grassy landscape **in gen 4, with low rolling hills in every direction. Often you can see the town’s ferris wheel in a park in the centre of town. NOTE: In older coverage, a distinct camera smudge can be seen on the right side of the camera.\n- The town of Bayankhongor, in central Mongolia, has an overall dry landscape and can be recognized from the nearby **large dry hill to the east,** with the Soyombo symbol inscribed onto it. NOTE: In older coverage, a distinct camera smudge can be seen on the right side of the camera.\n- In the central town of Tsetserleg, you will see these distinct **rocky**, **rugged hills,** with small trees growing on them to the north. It has very clear skies and the neighbourhoods can often be seen on the hilly slopes.\n- Murun is a town in the north built on a **north-south grid** with a large **jagged hill** nearby to the north. It has a lot of alley coverage with **dark cloudy skies** and muddy, unpaved roads. NOTE: Murun occasionally has sunny coverage where it isn’t cloudy, so consider other clues as well.\n- Hatgal is a small lake town on the Khuvsgul Lake. It can be recognized from its **fall coverage **with orange trees and grass, and the **large lake** in the northeast, where the Khuvsgul Ice Festival is held every year.\n- The small, hilly town of Tosontsengel, frequently has **red-tinted roads** and uses these unique lamp posts that have a **wavy design**.\n- Uliastai is a central-western Mongolian town, **surrounded by** **large, green nearby hills**. It is common to see a decent amount of **trees **or the **river **that runs through the town. In the centre of town, you can find a small hill with the Soyombo symbol inscribed on it.\n- In the town of Altai, you can see a **range of dark, distant hills** to the south and west and low rolling hills to the north and east. Additionally, it is common to see wet roads, as most of the coverage occurred after heavy rain. NOTE: In older coverage, a unique tent can be seen, which is inflated on the left side.\n- Khovd is a large, dry and shrubby town, in western Mongolia, that can be identified by the very distinct **rocky, red-tinted hills,** present to the** **north of town. NOTE: The nearby Khar-Us, Tugrug, and the samely named Khovd have similar landscapes but are much smaller towns.\n- Ölgii is a large town in the west, that is **surrounded by close, dry rocky mountains**. Towards the south end of town, there is a tall **red & white radio tower,** that can be seen from all across town and is quite distinct to Ölgii.\n- Ulaangom is a northwestern town with **large, distant, dark mountains** to the southwest. Additionally, these distinct **double lamp posts **with a blue or green painted base can frequently be seen in Ulaangom. NOTE: Rarely, double lamp posts can be found in other cities such as Baruun-Urt and Chinggis, but these towns have flat landscapes.\n- In the westmost part of Mongolia, there is some very remote coverage showcasing the tallest mountains in Mongolia where you can see glaciers and **snow-capped peaks**. This area also has a unique Street View car with a green or black bag above the right side roof racks.\n- East of Uvs lake, you can find a lot of these **small shrubs** and patchy grass in a somewhat flat landscape. NOTE: Similar shrubs can be found around Shaazgai Lake, but that area is considerably more hilly.\n- Khan Khokhii is a national park in northwestern Mongolia with some of the most **dense forests** in the country. It has partially cloudy skies, dark soil, and the western grey tent. Keep in mind that the trails in this park do not appear on the map. NOTE: There are other forests in Mongolia, but Khan Khokhii is one of the biggest and one of the only areas where you can be completely surrounded by trees.\n- The Gobi Gurvan Saikhan National Park, in the far south of Mongolia, features **bright orange sand** and **sand dunes**. There are two separate spots covered in the park: one in the middle just north of Sevrei, which has distant southern mountains, and the other in the far southwest corner of the park, which has a Jeep follow car.\n- Yolyn Am Valley is located just west of Dalanzadgad and can be identified by the **extremely foggy** coverage, and having dark coloured soil and hills.\n- This beautiful river valley, just west of Lake Hatgal in the Khoridol Saridag mountains, is very recognizable from the surrounding rocky cliffs and forests, and the ground that is completely **covered in pebbles**.\n- Mongolia has four main areas of **nighttime coverage**. Those areas are: - Northwest of Murun - West of Dashbalbar - South of Baruun-Urt - East of Dariganga All of these locations are **driving towards town**. Driving direction and car meta can help identify which area of nighttime coverage you are in.\n- East of the town of Khorgo there is a large stretch of road which was driven during a **rainstorm**. It features much darker skies, rain drops on the camera, and occasionally a rainbow can be seen."

As for the landscape, it’s flatter than around Windhoek, with only the occasional hill or mountain, otherwise the short golden grass, somewhat green acacia trees and shrubbery further away from the road is typical for middle to north Namibia. South of Sukses, you’ll see these two pointy mountains, one of which has a sharper peak than the other, to the west of the road.\n- You can recognise the B2 NE of Swakopmund by the sandy soil, and the mountain ridge visible to the east. A few lone mountains or hills can be seen to the NW as well. Beware that close to Swakopmund the sky is hazy, and you’ll not see the ridge. On this stretch, the coastal looking sandy soil and the NE bound road angle is still generally sufficient to confirm the road.\n- A bit further east, between Karibib and Usakos, you’ll find sunrise coverage combined with a sky covered in fairly thin clouds. There are mountains to the north, as well as smaller hills just south of the road, while it's mostly flat to the E-NE.\n- East of Karibib, the weather becomes completely clear, and the mountains are only visible further in the distance. The wide shoulder lines combined with the E-NE road angle makes this section distinct.\n- This desolate paved road goes in a general E-SE direction through a fairly flat and dry landscape. Small clouds dot the sky. The shrubbery is quite green for the most part, especially in the east, which is also very hilly. NOTE: The easiest way to tell it apart from parts of the B4 is the eastwards driving direction on this road, as opposed to westwards on the B4.\n- The B4 east of Luderitz has almost blindingly **bright sandy soil**. The landscape close to the road is generally flat, with hills and mountains in the distance. Close to Luderitz the landscape becomes much hillier. A railway follows the road closely on the south side for most of this section.\n- East of Aus, the road winds through some table-topped mountains, with the railway still just to the south. A similar landscape can briefly be found further east on the road, just east of the intersection with the D432, however the mountains are bigger, closer to the road and redder in colour.\n- After the road climbs onto the plateau east of Kuibis, the landscape will seem mostly flat until you reach the intersection with the D432, but you can notice the road having a gradual incline for long stretches. The soil around is very red in colour, with limited shrubbery or signs of life. The weather is clear, with some clouds far in the distance.\n- Between Seeheim and Keetmanshoop, the landscape close to the road is flat, with mountains always close by. Just east of Seeheim, you’ll see a short ridge to the NE, with a lone mountain just west of it, as well as a long ridge far away to the west. A bit east, on the NE-bound stretch, mountains are in all directions, but you’ll see a long uneven tabletop ridge to the west. A railroad can also be seen to the south on this stretch.\n- Road B6 goes in a general eastwards direction from Windhoek, with the landscape ranging from hilly close to Windhoek, to mostly flat closer to Gobabis. The soil is somewhat orange in colour, with short green grass and otherwise green vegetation growing from it. The cloud cover also varies, but no part of this road has a clear sky. NOTE: The only other similar paved road, road C39, has brighter soil.\n- You can recognise this long stretch of B8 by the **light coloured grainy pavement** as well as the general E-NE angle and vegetated northern landscape.\n- Bright soil, clear skies with cloud cover to the east over a tabletop mountain ridge makes this paved N-NW bound road distinct.\n- The C14 bears resemblance to the previous road, except this road is unpaved, and the skies are covered in a blanket of clouds, especially in the northern half. Near the southern end, the sky becomes clear. NOTE: The stretch south of Bethanien is paved.\n- Very red soil and small tufts of golden grass lining the road can be used to recognise the paved C19. The sky is mostly covered in dark clouds, especially to the north.\n- The C22 is a paved road generally going east, with freshly cut, orange tufts of grass along the road. A couple of large, rocky hills almost hug the road near the middle. The blinding sun low on the horizon to the east can also be helpful. NOTE: A short stretch near Okakarara was taken at a different time, making it less distinct. Look for the low ridge N-NW and the sun to the NNE to confirm.\n- A large rugged mountain formation can be seen to the west from the paved C13. Other smaller hills and mountains can be seen in other directions. Light coloured soil hugs the road, while more orange coloured soil can be seen further from the road, with light green vegetation and shrubbery acting as a contrast. Another easy way to get the road is to look for the wispy clouds trying to hide the sun in the east.\n- The C34 looks like darker streaks of black sand surrounded by more sand as far as the eye can see. Some coastal shrubbery, and even the coast can be seen in some parts. Unique white bollards with two yellow reflectors on the front, and one red in the back can also be seen along the road at regular intervals.\n- Red tinted and slightly grainy pavement along with the green savannah-like grassy landscape crowned with low-lying cumulus clouds can be used to recognise the northern section of road C35.\n- South of the C41 intersection, the road loses its red pavement, and the quality worsens. The landscape is less grassy, and more sandy, with hills to the west, though often hidden behind the vegetation. The road generally goes in a S-SE direction. Further south, it gets hillier, and parts will have a more SE bound angle. The sky is consistently covered by scattered cirrostratus and cumulus clouds.\n- A short section NW of Kamanjab along with the same somewhat green and hilly landscape, features an impressive array of clouds in the sky, with the sun attempting to peek out from the west. Hues of orange can be seen on the horizon.\n- A very rugged mountain formation can be seen to the west from a few sections of the C35 and its sideroads.\n- The C38 is yet another indistinct paved northern road with sandy soil, somewhat green vegetation and short grass lining the road. The sky, which is covered with a spotty blanket of clouds, is generally the most distinct clue. The sun is faintly shining through the clouds to the north.\n- Most of the C39 travels through a wide valley, with small vegetation-covered hills on both sides, which are mostly visible to the north. The N-NE angle and puffy cumulus clouds dotting the sunny sky are also noteworthy.\n- The C40 has a general NW angle going through flat terrain with the usual northern landscape of short grass next to the road, trees further away and some hills further in the distance. Similar to the C39, a lot of cumulus clouds dot the sky, and the closer to Kamanjab you get, the lower the sun sets to the west.\n- East of the intersection with the C35, the road has a constant SW to NW angle, and grainy pavement. The grass looks soft to the touch, and the somewhat sandy soil is typical of this region. Cumulus clouds dot the sky. West of the C35 intersection, the same grainy pavement and clouds remain, but the landscape is much hillier, and the road angle changes.\n- Along the C43 you can find some of the most impressive red-coloured tabletop mountains. The road is wide and unpaved with light coloured gravel contrasting the otherwise red landscape.\n- The C44 is a** wide unpaved sandy road** lined with trees, easily recognised from the general E-SE angle, and the **westbound driving direction**. NOTE: The D3301, a bit further south looks similar, but the soil is generally much redder, and the car is driving east.\n- The C47 is an **even wider unpaved road**, with slightly** redder soil** when compared to the C44. The road angle on this road is NE bound, with a SW driving direction. You can also look for either a clear sky, or wispy clouds.\n- Often fairly **poor quality pavement** with only white road lines, no road lines at all, or just slightly faded road lines and red tinted pavement, are all good clues for the C49 in the panhandle. Near the western end, the sun is very low in the sky, and the weather is fully clear. NOTE: A small section by Makolonga has good pavement with wide shoulders, so look for the orange patches on the road.\n- The D3600 and the unlabelled road going NE to Mpungu, have a very light coloured, sometimes grainy pavement, with at times very faded yellow lines, which are hard to even see. Combined with the either exactly N to S or NE angle, as well as the northern landscape, make this road very distinct.\n- A few roads in the north lack the typical outer yellows. - The C46, which is a long road going generally NW to SE. The E-W section by Ruacana, has very poor pavement. SE of Oshikuku, the sun is low in the sky to the NW. - C41 (M123) also has a NW angle but has more clouds in the sky than the C46. - B10 west of Eenhana is an E-W stretch, which is more vegetated, and also has the sun low in the sky to the west. - B10 east of Nkurenkuru is another NW bound stretch with the sun low in the sky, but this part is much more vegetated than the C46. You can also see the moon to the east. - D3615 is a short road with a constant N-NE angle that technically has outer yellows, but they are quite faded.\n- Windhoek is by far the largest city in Namibia, as well as the richest, with many high rise buildings near downtown. Affluent and often gated single family houses are a common sight on the sides of hilly streets, which are often well marked with simple white street signs. In the northwest of the city you’ll find the slums dotting the hills.\n- Gobabis is a big** north-south gridded** city in the desert, with** red soil** permeating the landscape and roads, which are very often unpaved. A faint green ridge is sometimes visible to the north to northwest. The street signs, while rare, are also green, with silver framing on the top and bottom. Blue bins are also a good clue for Gobabis.\n- The coastal cities of Swakopmund and Walvis Bay are **flat **and often have** sandy streets**, with **palms** and Norfolk pines planted around. Street and road signs often have square-shaped signposts. Road angles can be used to line up parts of the city, but a northeast bound angle is common in both. These white and blue plastic containers are common in Swakopmund, as are yellow lamp posts in downtown areas.\n- While very similar to Swakopmund and Walvis Bay, Henties Bay is less gridded and noticeably poorer, with most roads being unpaved. Unlike in Swakopmund, where yellow lamps are only found near the downtown, here they can occasionally be found throughout the town. The cloudy weather can be used to confirm the town.\n- Langstrand is a small resort town between Swakopmund and Walvis Bay with **pink brick sidewalks** next to essentially every road. The weather is always **overcast **and gloomy.\n- **Light coloured rocky hillsides** are everywhere in the hilly coastal town of Luderitz.\n- Oranjemund is a well-off gridded city with almost exactly east to west streets, with an abundance of** planted vegetation** all around the city. Multiple Norfolk pines can be seen almost everywhere. Streets are well organised with E-W avenues and N-S streets, which can be seen written on small blue markers next to the gates or on street signs, which have varying designs.\n- Orange coloured **thatched fences**, **walls**, and **huts **are everywhere in the desert town of Aussenkehr, which is built on the slope of a hill.\n- While not as common, the same thatched architecture is present in Noordoewer, and unlike Aussenkehr, the town was built on flat land, with an imposing cliffside visible to the southwest, across the border in South Africa. Similar mountains can be seen to the north as well.\n- Rosh Pinah can easily be recognised by the dry mountains just northeast of the city, as well as slightly further away to the southwest.\n- The landscape of Aus is very rocky, with dry hills devoid of vegetation all around. The hills to the north have a fairly smooth sloped shape, while the peaks to the south are more rugged.\n- While not entirely unique, most streets in Rundu consist of **deep** and **light coloured sand**, with a bumpy texture, and** tire tracks engraved** into it.\n- **Orange coloured mountains**, which are covered in** green vegetation** surround the partly hilly town of Opuwo, from where you have a great vantage point of the mountains.\n- Otavi sits in between many sets of mountains, all of which are quite far away, but can be seen from the city. Being a northern town, Otavi is quite green, with slightly reddish sandy soil, which is common for the more northern cities. The entire town is on a northeast to southwest grid, which can rule out similar looking cities like Grootfontein and Tsumeb.\n- From almost anywhere in Karibib the dark silhouette of Erongo Mountain can be seen to the north. Dry hills covered in shrubbery flank the town to the south.\n- A lone** tall ridge** with a **rugged, striated texture** lies to the SSE of Usakos. Another smaller plain textured mountain, which has a red tint to it, is just to the east, or northeast, depending on part of town. From the northern part of town, the cliffy edges of Erongo Mountain are visible to the north.\n- The crown-like outline of Mt Brandeburg is barely visible to the northwest from most parts of Uis, while Many other dry hills surround the town. The open pit mines, which have a distinctive white colour, can be seen from the western half of Uis.\n- Ariamsvlei can be recognised by a single flat-topped hill with rocky ridgelines near the top, and small amounts of green shrubbery dotting the slopes. The hill is either to the north, or east, depending on the part of town. The soil has a dark red tint to it, with lots of bushes and small trees growing around the place."

                "description": "- Nepali licence plates are typically fairly long, with the most common design being white. Private vehicles use red plates, while public vehicles use black ones.\n- All of the road coverage in Nepal was taken with what’s commonly referred to as **“shitcam”**, which is a low-quality camera that can typically be recognised by the brownish colours and often, but not always, by a large circular blur covering the Street View car. NOTE: Shitcam coverage is also very common in India and can rarely be found in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.\n- Nepal drives on the** left side** of the road.\n- Nepal uses the **Devanagari script**, which can be recognised by the line going through the top of each word and the straight vertical lines found in the majority of all letters. NOTE: The characters ङ and especially ङ्ग are much more common in Nepali than in Hindi/Marathi. It is also quite common to find native Devanagari numbers on signage in Nepal, which is very rare in India.\n- Nepal typically uses square concrete poles in the flat areas, and thin metallic poles in the mountainous regions. The poletops vary, but it is often some kind of trident. The concrete pole with a trident pole top and triangle supports is unique to Nepal. Another common pole almost unique to Nepal is a concrete square pole with 2 vertical insulators on the sides with a wide gap between them. Other poles can often appear very similar to poles in India.\n- Nepal commonly uses **outer yellow road lines** that are either dashed or solid, with dashed white lines in the middle of bigger roads. Solid outer yellows are very common in eastern Bagmati province.\n- Nepal mainly uses **black-and-white striped concrete bollards** that often have a **red marking** on the top. The amount of stripes vary from 3 to 5.\n- You will see **flat agricultural areas** in the south as well as high altitude **mountain roads** in the northern half of Nepal.\n- Most buildings are either colorful blocky multi-story structures or small houses with painted concrete, red brick, or thatched looking walls, with either a tiled or tin roof. As part of the building facade, you will often spot triangle shaped decorations.\n- Nepal uses black-and-white striped signposts. NOTE: Within South and Southeast Asia, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Malaysia also use black-and-white striped signposts.\n- This type of **white-painted buddhist stupa**, sometimes with painted eyes on the sides, are only found in Nepal."

                "description": "- Districts can show up on addresses, often in English as well.\n- The area in the far south close to the Indian border is almost completely flat, while the central and northern parts are very high altitude and very mountainous.\n- The western hills can be recognised by the **dry landscape**, with a lot of exposed hillsides lacking vegetation.\n- **Areca Palms** can be recognised by their very thin trunk and a small crown. They are mainly found in the southeast.\n- **Canola, **a crop with bright yellow flowers, is mostly found in a few southern pockets in the western half of Nepal.\n- **Chir Pines**, which can be identified from their generally smooth-looking conical or spherical crowns with very long needles, are found everywhere in the mountains, but are much more common in the west, and near Kathmandu. NOTE: The eastern region is generally greener than the west.\n- Grass with white and fluffy-looking tips is most commonly found just southeast of Kathmandu. While it can be found in most of the country, it usually won’t look as white and fluffy outside the dark red coloured region.\n- Japanese cedar trees, which are only found in far eastern Nepal, can typically be recognised by their significant height combined with their narrow, fluffy-looking crowns.\n- Tea Plantations are also only found in far eastern Nepal. Both in the mountains, and in the flat region.\n- **Rounded roof tiles** are most common in the flat regions south of Kathmandu, but are also prevalent further west. NOTE: Don’t mix this up with the half-rounded tiles, which are part of the hint below this.\n- West Bengal style roof tiles, which are more organised and have small **diamond shaped protrusions**, are most common in the far west flat region. This hint also works for the half-rounded tiles.\n- Flat **square shaped stone tiles** that are grey in colour are common south of Kathmandu, more specifically around Birgunj and Janakpur. NOTE: Neat, square, stone tiles are not found in parts of India that tend to look similar to Nepal.\n- Rectangular tiles that are** less organised** in shape and placement are common in western mountain towns, but can also be found towards the center of the country.\n- Roofs made from sheets of** corrugated metal** are most common between Birgunj and Janakpur.\n- Roofs that have a **railing** along the sides of the roofs, usually made of dark concrete, are found in some parts of western Nepal. They are most common in the Tulsipur valley, where the railings sometimes have a stair shape. The easternmost region where they’re found is the plains by Kawasoti. The westernmost regions often have lower quality “railings”, sometimes consisting of a few sticks.\n- Gable ends decorated by **carvings of gods**, goddesses, and other religious symbols, usually painted in a golden colour, are mostly around Kawasoti, west of Bharatpur.\n- Fences of varying build quality, made of mainly sticks, are most commonly found in the eastern plains of Nepal.\n- In the far east, you will mainly see roofs made of sheet metal with a triangular \"window\" just below the ridge of the roof, and an outwards sloping section below it.\n- Large hip roofs made of sheet metal with a small protrusion just below the ridge are found around Biratnagar in the east.\n- Similar to the above hint, hip roofs made of sheet metal with an even smaller protruding piece of metal at the ridge are mainly found west of and around Biratnagar.\n- Mosques are concentrated in a few muslim majority spots in southern Nepal. - In the east, just around Janakpur. - In the east, just around Birgunj. - In the west, just around Nepalgunj. - In the east, around Biratnagar and west of the Koshi river.\n- Small** round clay huts** with **thatched roofs** are mainly found around Birgunj. NOTE: These are also common just over the border in India.\n- Poles with a **cross** attached near the top are common in the east.\n- In Kathmandu, you’ll find poles with an asymmetrical crossbar, which has a triangular attachment on top of it, as well as a support bar below it.\n- While the most common water tank colours in Nepal are green and black, which are found everywhere, **yellow** ones are mainly found in the east.\n- An orange google car can be found around: - Nepalgunj in the west - Madi, south of Bharatpur in the central south - Biratnagar in the east - Birtamod in the far east.\n- An orange car with a blue ribbon on the front is found around Biratnagar.\n- A blue car is found around: - Pokhara, under the Nepal label - Birgunj, southwest of Kathmandu - Malangawa, near the Indian border southeast of Kathmandu.\n- If the blue car has an antenna, you will be around Pokhara.\n- A white car can be found in the following areas: - Around Butwal, southwest of the Nepal label - On the H10 going to Pokhara - On the H04 east to Kathmandu - On some roads near Kathmandu - Northeast of Birgunj, southwest of Kathmandu - From Janakpur to Lahan, southeast of Kathmandu - Around Itahari, in the east.\n- A car with a black spoiler is found just around Janakpur, southeast of Kathmandu.\n- A regular grey car can be found around Kathmandu, and to the southeast, around Lahan.\n- A blocky grey truck can be found east of Birgunj and just south of Kathmandu.\n- A grey car with a visible backlight can be found in the following areas: - Around Pokhara, under the Nepal label - Around Kathmandu - North of Malangawa, near the Indian border southeast of Kathmandu - East of Itahari, in the east.\n- A red car, that usually has a long antenna, can be found in Kathmandu, and north of Janakpur, which is southeast of Kathmandu."

                "description": "- Some roads north of Siddhicharan, in eastern Nepal are unique due to the high elevation hills with dark green rhododendron bushes growing in abundance. The bushes have red flowers which can be hard to see.\n- This foggy and gloomy road hosts the only natural forest dominated by east himalayan fir. You can recognise it from all the tall dark trees present around the road. It is located just northwest of Bhimeshwor Municipality, east of Kathmandu.\n- This sketchy yellow/orange dirt road can be recognised from the high elevation landscape with the high elevation oaks. It can be found northeast of Phungling in far northeastern Nepal.\n- This dirt track in a northwestbound valley can be recognised by the **snowcapped mountains** to the northwest. You can find it north of the Khaptad national park in western Nepal.\n- Trekker coverage in Nepal is limited to the **northeast** of the country, in the general area southwest of Mount Everest.\n- **Green forests** and trees are found in the southern parts of the Nepalese trekker coverage.\n- **Barren mountain trails** are found in the northern parts of the coverage.\n- A lot of the coverage in the vicinity of Namche Bazar can be summarised as being sunny, with the trails going **close to the treeline**, meaning you will be either near the top of or just above a forest for most of this coverage. You will generally see barren or snowy mountains in some direction.\n- Namche Bazar is by far the **largest** and **most densely populated** settlement with trekker coverage. There is also some coverage looking down on the town.\n- The southernmost trekker coverage is situated in the town of Lukla, which can be recognised by the narrow street with relatively large buildings, combined with the **extremely dark coverage**.\n- Khumjung village, situated just north of Namche Bazar, can be recognised by the **jagged mountain** towering above the village. Almost every house in the village has a **green roof**. Beware that there is a label for Khumjung further north, which is not close to the village.\n- Pangboche is a fairly large settlement with fairly bright coverage. The surrounding landscape mainly consists of **forested mountains** nearby and some taller mountains in the distance.\n- Phorste is a fairly scarcely built settlement with a massive **recognizable mountain** close by. There are a lot of dead-looking trees surrounding the village.\n- Around the southern tip of the Nepalese trekker coverage, you will get this **dark**, overcast coverage inside a forested valley.\n- North of Phakding you will get more overcast coverage in the same forest valley, however here the coverage is **far brighter**.\n- The coverage from Monjo up to Namche Bazar is also within the same valley, however here the coverage is mostly **sunny** and bright.\n- The valley by Thamu can be recognised by the generally forested mountainsides, combined with the **angle of the valley**, going northwest to southeast.\n- Next to the village of Thame you can see this snowy, and **shining bright** mountain range.\n- Northeast of Namche Bazar, you can find this **semi-green river valley** with clouds covering all mountains surrounding it.\n- On a section north of Phorste, you get a view of the mountain Tobuche, covered in a **blanket of clouds**.\n- Further north, the cloud blanket is replaced by **small, spotty clouds** somewhat resembling smoke coming out of chimneys.\n- Even further north, the clouds disappear completely, and you get a **clear view** of the Tobuche peak.\n- Leaving Tobuche behind, you will find this small, **ice-covered lake**, right by Gokyo, with jagged mountains as a backdrop.\n- North of the icy lake, you reach a barren landscape, with a trail going to the **north-north-west**.\n- East of Gokyo, you reach this **dried out glacial valley**, with bright grey rocks as far as you can see. NOTE: This valley can less commonly be seen from the trail north of Gokyo.\n- East of the glacial valley, you get to a somewhat **red-coloured**, rugged mountainside **right next to the trail**.\n- Leaving the red mountainside behind, you enter a somewhat **U-shaped valley**, going firmly upwards.\n- Above the U-shaped valley, you get a view of this **spiky mountain range**. While there are some clouds around the peaks, they are mostly clearly visible.\n- As you lose sight of the spiky mountains, you cross over a **glacier**, which is the largest patch of snow covered ground with coverage in the country.\n- The area east of the glacier can be recognised by the many **irregular clouds** spread across the sky and covering various mountain peaks.\n- Further along the trail, you get this stunning **view over Tobuche** from the eastern side. The mountains get increasingly covered in clouds to the west.\n- Closing in on the final trek toward Everest, you get a view of this wide, **high-altitude river valley**.\n- Slightly east of Namche Bazar, you can find this very overcast trail following the mountainside. There are still some trees around, and the trail is noticeably **higher** above the valley than other overcast sections with trees.\n- East of the POI called ‘Deboche’, you get this very **overcast forest coverage**. The dirt here is very bright and sandy, which can help differentiate it from the southern trail.\n- You can recognise the trail between Pangboche and Dingboche by the massive mountains, combined with the sun looking somewhat **hazy**.\n- North of Dingboche, you reach a high-altitude valley with very **low clouds** covering the sky and most of the surrounding mountains.\n- Closing in on Everest, you get this completely barren landscape, with the trail going to the **north-north-east**.\n- Reaching the endpoint of the coverage, you finally get a stunning view of the world's tallest mountain, **Mount Everest**."

                "title": "Identifying the Netherlands",
                "description": "- The Netherlands has long, **yellow licence plates** with the standard European blue strip on the left. Dutch taxis have blue plates. NOTE: The only other countries in Europe with yellow licence plates are Luxembourg and the UK. For the UK, only the back plates are yellow, and they often lack the blue strip. In addition, some older coverage in France features the French yellow back plates. In Denmark, you can find yellow plates on commercial vehicles.\n- **Dutch** is a Germanic language. It features a lot of double vowels. Typical letter clusters are ij, ieuw and oe. “IJ“ written as one capitalised letter is also unique to the language. NOTE: Dutch is also used in the region of Flanders, which comprises the northern half of Belgium.\n- The Netherlands has a simple, white **bollard** with a red reflector. NOTE: On rare occasions, you can find round French-style bollards with a red band and a pointed top. A difference with French bollards is that the red wrap usually does not go all the way around the bollard.\n- The Netherlands usually **does not have any utility poles**. You might see larger power lines like the ones shown in the image, but essentially never any street-level smaller utility poles. NOTE: Belgium does use utility poles somewhat commonly.\n- The Netherlands is extraordinarily **flat**. In most of the country, you will get no more than a few metres of elevation. Large swathes of the country are reclaimed land that is at or even below sea level. NOTE: The most major exception to this is the south of Limburg, where you can get low hills. Another place with some amount of hills is De Veluwe in central Gelderland province.\n- In addition, the Netherlands is a very water-rich country. The country has innumerous **waterways**. Canals and ditches next to the road are common. Water management is an important facet of Dutch infrastructure, so you will often see dikes (low earthen walls to protect against water), dams and bridges.\n- Many rural roads are **lined by rows of trees**. NOTE: This is also common in Poland.\n- The Netherlands has a high amount of urban planning, and as a result tends to have a **very organised look**. Road infrastructure is well-maintained. Suburbs are usually master-planned and typically feature row houses.\n- Like most of Europe, the Netherlands has **all-white** road lines. Many roads have dashed outside lines. Sometimes, you can find unique green middle lines.\n- Many Dutch roads are flanked by **bicycle paths**. Different designs exist, but a very common one is a reddish-pink lane. Cycling is one of the most common modes of transportation in the Netherlands. You will see cyclists and bicycles everywhere.\n- **Brick roads** are common in the Netherlands, both in rural and urban areas. The brick pattern shown in the image is especially common.\n- Most Dutch **sidewalks** use the same type of square grey tiles and offset tiling pattern. In some historic areas, you might find smaller brick sidewalks.\n- The Netherlands has very recognizable **speed bumps**. They usually have white warning stripes that alternate between long and short. The example image is on a brick road, but they also occur on asphalt roads.\n- Many rural roads feature a sort of **brick rumble strip** on the sides. This is fairly unique to the Netherlands and a good way to identify the country in very rural rounds.\n- Street signs are almost always **blue with white lettering**. Very rarely, you can find yellow, white or green street signs. The Dutch word for street is **straat**. Other common road name endings are -weg, -laan, -pad, and -plein. However, if you see a blue sign with the word ‘fietspad’, do not search for it; it simply means ‘bicycle path’. NOTE: Street signs in Belgium come in a variety of colours and usually mention the municipality, which is rare in the Netherlands.\n- Dutch **direction signs** are blue with white lettering. Signs for bicyclists are white with a red border.\n- Dutch **town entry signs** are blue. The signs sometimes have very elaborate designs, often with frames and additional signs. NOTE: Often, these signs list the municipality they are in, after the word ‘gemeente’ (gem). Many municipalities are named after larger towns or cities in the vicinity, which can help a lot with scanning.\n- Dutch **road markers** are green. Many list the road number in a small yellow or red box. Highways have a red box and start with the letter **A**. Regional roads have a yellow box and start with the letter **N**. NOTE: Some of them have province-specific designs. You can learn more about this in the region-guessing section.\n- Edges of Dutch road signs will extend to the back, creating a **border visible from behind**, sometimes retaining the colour of the sign. This is both consistent and unique to the country.\n- Many Dutch signposts feature **striped markings** with a black-and-white or blue-and-white colour scheme.\n- Road signs on traffic islands often have these bulky **yellow signposts**.\n- On some roads, especially in rural areas, you might find these distinctive **striped barriers**.\n- **Brick architecture** is very common in the Netherlands. Many buildings feature red-brownish-coloured bricks. Roofs often have orange or dark grey tiles. NOTE: Similar brick architecture is also common in Denmark and Belgium.\n- As mentioned before, **row houses** are very common in the Netherlands. Almost half of the Dutch housing stock are row houses, significantly more than almost all other European countries.\n- **Windmills**, both traditional water or grain mills, and modern wind power turbines, are common in the Netherlands.\n- Some Generation 4 coverage has a car blur glitch where the **black back of the Google car** is visible.\n- The Netherlands also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Western Europe also has smallcam."

NOTE: Dutch mobile phone numbers start with 06, which is a code that is not used for any of the landline area codes. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Some road markers (“**hectometre markers**”) have province-specific designs. This only applies to markers for regional N-roads, which have road numbers in yellow boxes. Not all N-road markers have province-specific designs: some just have a generic design that can be found nationwide. The A-roads all have the same signs and are recognizable because the road number is in a red box. Bollards sometimes feature **kilometre stickers**, which are also limited to specific regions. _You can click on the image to enlarge it. Image provided by Timzkii._\n- All Dutch provinces have their own flag. However, most of these are very rarely seen in the wild. The major exceptions to this are the flags of **Friesland** and **Noord-Brabant**. In addition, you can sometimes see the unofficial but very popular flag of the Achterhoek cultural region in the east of Gelderland. For a full list of all provincial flags, you can view this Wikipedia page.\n- In the province of Friesland, the Frisian language is commonly spoken. While Dutch language is still most prevalent on signs, a lot of town entry signs will feature **bilingual town names**. Some street names in Friesland uniquely end in -wei or -strjitte. NOTE: Frisian has vowels with circumflex diacritics (“little hats”): Â, Ê, Ô and Û. Dutch does not have these letters, except in loanwords. In addition, the Y is significantly more common compared to Dutch.\n- This long, vertically arranged white sticker with three to four digits is found on street lights in Limburg.\n- Similarly to Limburg, North Brabant also has white stickers on their street lights, however it is horizontally arranged and only has one or two digits.\n- Most of the **west and north** is at or below sea-level. As a result, most of this region’s countryside has a distinct “**polder**” landscape: the landscape is marshy, often with a large amount of small waterways.\n- Conversely, the **south and the east** tends to have a more typical flat European farmland look. Waterways are still common, but the landscape can look less marshy.\n- While most of the Netherlands is very flat, Southern Limburg has some **low hills**.\n- The **Veluwe** area is unusually forested for Dutch standards. Some parts feature a very slight amount of elevation. Some parts of the Veluwe feature old-growth forest, heath or sandy soil. This area can look odd and unlike the rest of the Netherlands if you have never seen it before. NOTE: Some other natural areas in the Netherlands can have a similar look, but the Veluwe is by far the largest.\n- Almost all of the land belonging to the province of Flevoland was reclaimed from the sea in the mid-20th century. As a result, the province has a distinct, **man-made** look: extremely straight roads and large crop fields dominate the landscape. Wind turbines are common. In urban areas, there are no historical buildings. NOTE: The only exception to this description is the town of Urk, which is situated on a former island now surrounded by the rest of the province’s man-made polder landscape.\n- Most of the Dutch North Sea coast is lined by **dunes**.\n- The islands in the northwest are called the **Wadden Islands**. They are very popular local tourism destinations, which is sometimes evident in the street view coverage. Their northwestern coastlines feature a lot of sand dunes.\n- Farms in the north of the Netherlands often have **very large roofs**.\n- **Rolling shutters** on house windows are more common in the southern half of the Netherlands. NOTE: While more prevalent in the south, rolling shutters on homes in more northern regions are not unheard of. Use this meta with some caution.\n- **Curaçao** is a constituent country in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, located north of western Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea. As such, for country streaks purposes, it is counted as the Netherlands. Plonk It has a more in-depth guide to Curaçao here."

They sometimes have tall roof spires, usually painted white.\n- The **Afsluitdijk** is a very recognizable man-made causeway between Noord-Holland and Friesland. It is a divided highway that runs in a very straight southwest to northeast direction. You can see water to your southeast, and a dike to your northwest. NOTE: There are other large causeways and dams in the Netherlands, but the Afsluitdijk is the biggest and has a very recognizable road direction.\n- In the Westland municipality, just southwest of The Hague, **greenhouses** are extremely common. They cover most of the municipality’s land surface.\n- In the southern part of the Veluwe, in** National Park De Hoge Veluwe**, you can find a trekker that is recognizable because the Google employee’s brown hair is visible.\n- The **harbour of Rotterdam** is one of the largest in the world. It extends all the way from downtown Rotterdam to the North Sea coast. If you see a lot of industrial activity, often in combination with large, round **fuel storage tanks**, there is a good chance that you are in this harbour area. NOTE: Amsterdam and Delfzijl also have large harbours. Both also feature a lot of fuel storage tanks.\n- Many **streets in Lelystad** follow a fairly distinct naming scheme: instead of having unique names, they are named after the neighbourhood they are in, followed by a number. Some of these neighbourhood names show up on the Google map.\n- **Baarle** is a town in the south of the Netherlands which contains a number of Belgian enclaves. Throughout the town, you can sometimes see signs of this, such as markings on the pavement and Dutch and Belgian flags being flown together."

NOTE: It is rare to find bins with green lids outside of Christchurch. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- The Waikato and Northland regions are characterised by their **drier climate** and **rolling hills**. In particular, the Northland region is quite hilly. NOTE: This type of landscape can be found in other parts of the North Island, but is more common in the mentioned regions.\n- The West Coast and part of the Tasman region on the South Island can be recognized by its **temperate rainforests** and **rugged landscape**. This can be seen through the hundreds of tall hills and mountains, as well as the dark, compact greenery which is due to the area’s high level of rainfall.\n- The flatter parts of the Southland and Otago regions can be recognised by their **cold climate** and **sloping, alpine hills**. The vegetation in this area is often quite stunted due to the climate.\n- The Southern Alps, a **large, snowy mountain range,** stretches throughout the majority of the South Island. Vegetation on the mountains becomes rarer the further south it is.\n- Hawke’s Bay** **has **dry, golden grassy hills**, and in Generation 4 it will be sunny with a white Street View car.\n- **Bright sandy cliffs** are a common sight in the central region of Manawatū-Whanganui. They may also be found in parts of Taranaki, Waikato and a road going into Hawke’s Bay. NOTE: Sometimes the cliffs may appear like sandy rocks.\n- The area of the Southern Alps, north and south of Queenstown, contains many **glacial lakes**, which can be recognized by their teal colours and clear waters.\n- Mount Taranaki, often referred to as Mount Egmont, is easily distinguished due to its relatively **smooth slopes** and its pointed, often snowy peak. It can frequently be identified from afar, as the surrounding area is flat.\n- **Generation 2** coverage and gravel roads are particularly common in the Northland region. NOTE: These tips do not exclusively indicate Northland. Be sure to use other clues when making guesses.\n- **Tall hedge and tree rows** are particularly common in the Canterbury region. They are mostly found in the Canterbury plains, which comprises very flat, large fields. Due to Canterbury’s flat landscape, mountains can often be seen in the distance to the west. NOTE: Hedges that are even taller are common near Tauranga.\n- **Very tall hedges** are found in the Bay of Plenty, mainly around Tauranga. NOTE: Noticeably lower, but still tall, hedges are commonly found in Canterbury.\n- **Vineyards** are particularly common in the Marlborough and Hawke’s Bay regions. NOTE: Vineyards can be found throughout New Zealand, so be sure to check other clues as well.\n- **Corn **is almost exclusively found on the North Island.\n- While New Zealand flax can be found across the country, if you see them in **long neat rows**, you should consider Southland.\n- Most utility poles in the Marlborough region have a long** square shaped olive-brown possum guard**.

These are also more rarely found in western Otago.\n- **Holey poles** are found most commonly in Southland and around Auckland.\n- **Square concrete poles **without the usual indent are most common in Southland, but can also be found in Otago, Taranaki and Manawatū-Whanganui.\n- Uneven crossbars, meaning they are **off-centre**, are found in Otago, Marlborough, Wellington and Taranaki.\n- Poles with the middle insulator being installed on top of a **tall metal bar** are often found along the Auckland Waikato border, as well as in other parts of Waikato. NOTE: Insulators installed on significantly shorter vertical bars are rarer and can be found all across the country.\n- Some concrete poles in eastern Waikato and Whanganui city have **white paint** on the middle part of their wooden crossbars. This white painted crossbar can also be found in parts of western Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Manawatū-Whanganui and eastern Wellington.\n- A **yellow tag**, similar in appearance to a cow-tag, is found on most poles in Gisborne. It is also found in a few spots on the South Island, as well as over the border in northern Hawke’s Bay.\n- A warning sticker attached to poles, which has a **yellow danger triangle between** **two white rectangles**, is found in Hawke’s Bay, from lake Taupo to lake Rotorua, in northern Waikato and south of Auckland city.\n- A medium sized **black vertical** **sticker** with **5 digits** is found in West Coast, Tasman, southern Canterbury and southern Northland.\n- A long **black vertical sticker** with **6 digits **with a **small black square** beneath it, is found on most of the North Island, in Southland and in Otago. On the North Island the first digit will be a 3 or a 4, while on the South Island it starts with an 8. NOTE: There is a similar regional black sticker with 6 digits but without a small square below it. Additionally, the sticker can rarely be white.\n- Poles near Timaru often have a **tall rectangle of** **orange paint** on them with the text “DANGER LIVE WIRES”.\n- A **small black horizontal pole sticker**, with several numbers, is often found in Taranaki and Wellington.

NOTE: The edges of the plate must be straight, meaning they cannot be rounded. Rounded plates are seen all across the country.\n- Solid outer white lines without middle lines are most common in Gisborne, but can also be found in northern Hawke's Bay and Wellington. NOTE: The roads in Wellington are typically narrower.\n- A typical bollard, but with a** green stripe**, is common in southern Canterbury, as well as in some pockets in eastern Southland.\n- A typical bollard but with a **black stripe** instead of a red one is commonly found in Wellington, especially in older Generation 3 coverage.\n- **Wooden **fences with **tightly packed fence posts** are most common on the North Island and the north of the South Island, as well as on the Banks peninsula.\n- **Wooden fences** with a** big gap** in-between them are most common on the South island as well as in Taranaki.\n- Fences with **thin** **metal fence posts** are almost exclusive to the South island.\n- **Short pieces of** **wood **attached to a fence post, slightly extending it, can often be found on fences in Hawke’s Bay and occasionally in Manawatū-Whanganui and Gisborne.\n- Similar wooden extensions, which are **significantly longer**, are mainly found in Southland and Hawke’s Bay, but can also be seen in Otago.\n- This car with a **white and blue** front is mostly found on the North Island. It can occasionally be found In Canterbury and Marlborough, on the South Island.\n- This Street View car features a **white-blue-white** pattern which is **blurred **out, and is mainly found on the South Island or around and north of Auckland."

It is easily recognized due to the distinct bay, which is often filled with** small boats**. There is only Generation 3 camera coverage.\n- The area around Tongariro National Park is identifiable due to the **low-lying volcanic vegetation** in the area. Mount Ruapehu and Mount Tongariro are in the vicinity, and their tops are often covered by clouds.\n- Coverage on Mount Ruapehu is easily identifiable due to the **dark volcanic landscape **and distinct lack of vegetation. NOTE: This type of coverage is limited to the roads around the Whakapapa Ski Village.\n- In 2011, Christchurch was hit by an earthquake. As a result, roads on coverage from 2012 often appear in quite bad shape. Water damage caused many driveways to be cut off from streets due to large puddles of water, dirt or mud. Due to this reason, many residential houses in the city had to be removed, leading to several districts on newer coverage appearing like normal suburbs, but with almost no houses. This is noticeable when looking at where former driveways used to be.\n- Part of State Highway 85 in Otago has **light snow coverage, **specifically between the towns of Becks and Morisson.\n- The cities of Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt can be identified by the **wide, green valley** they are located in, which runs southwest to northeast.\n- Blenheim can be recognized by having a **large range of hills** to the north and the south of the city.\n- **Fruit farms** covered in **green netting** are particularly common near Tauranga, but can also be seen near Gisborne. NOTE: Fruit farms are not fully exclusive to these regions, so make sure to consider other clues as well.\n- Banks peninsula, also sometimes called Akaroa, due to the town, is **rocky with grassy hills,** and small patches of trees. NOTE: This region can sometimes have gorse, which are also commonly found on the Otago peninsula.\n- The region of northern Marlborough, known as Marlborough Sounds, has **densely forested mountains protruding from water**. NOTE: Northern Marlborough is almost exclusively in Generation 4.\n- The Otago peninsula east of Dunedin is recognizable from its combination of plants such as cabbage trees, yellow flowered bushes, small groves of cone-shaped pine trees, and New Zealand flax. Additionally, the peninsula’s poles often have off-centre crossbars.\n- State Highway 73, located near Arthur’s Pass, can be recognised by the almost dried out river with an **abundance of gravel **on the river bed. Additionally, the Street View car in Arthur’s Pass drove behind a black pickup truck with two ladders** **on its roof.\n- State Highway 94 is characterised by its dense** ****red beech**** forest **surrounded by **snow-capped mountains**.\n- State Highway 80 in the Southern Alps is recognizable by its north-south orientation up a **glacial valley**. The west side of the road is lined with snow-capped mountains, while the east side of the road runs alongside the Tasman River and Lake Pukaki.\n- The mountains of Pirongia and Kakepuku are often seen together in an otherwise mostly flat landscape. To the west, we have Mount Pirongia which is a long mountain range, with **2 distinct small bumps**. Meanwhile Mount Kakepuku is to the south and has a **volcanic cone shape**.\n- The volcano of Putauaki in eastern Bay of Plenty has a seemingly cut-off top which vaguely resembles the shape of a frog, with two big “eyes” protruding on either side of the top."

However, due to little coverage, the mountains are rarely visible.\n- Shown is a **Köppen climate map** of Nigeria. The climate ranges from tropical rainforest in the far south, where you can find an abundance of palms with lush, green vegetation, to a more arid, savannah landscape in the centre, with more scattered trees.

NOTE: Finland and Denmark are both mostly flat, while Sweden has a mixture of flat, hilly and mountainous areas.\n- The vast majority of Norwegian houses are made of **wood**. Many houses are painted **red**, which is also typical for Sweden and Finland. **Black** painted houses are also quite common, more so than in Sweden or Finland. NOTE: While the architecture is very similar to that of Sweden and Finland, there are some small, general differences. Sweden and Finland generally have more red and yellow houses, while Norway generally has more white houses. There is also a larger percentage of wooden houses in suburbs and near town centres in Norway than in Sweden and Finland, which use more brick than Norway.\n- Norway has long white licence plates with the standard European strip on the left. Commercial plates are **green**. These are often seen on vans. NOTE: Within Europe, green licence plates are most commonly seen in Norway, but can also be found on electric vehicles in several other countries.\n- Smaller Norwegian roads typically have **long dashed** white outer lines, while larger roads have solid outer lines and **yellow middle lines**. The yellow lines have a distinct tinge of orange. NOTE: Sweden only has white road lines, and the dashes on outer lines are shorter than in Norway. Finnish outer road lines are always solid, and middle lines can be yellow or white.\n- Road lines will often be made up of **small dots** of paint.\n- The Norwegian language contains the special letters Æ, Ø and Å. NOTE: The special letters found in Norwegian can also be found in some of the other Northern Germanic languages: - Danish uses Æ, Ø and Å. - Swedish uses Å, but not Æ or Ø. Norwegian also uses more E’s than Swedish, while Swedish uses more A’s instead. Norwegian uses “kk” where Swedish uses “ck”. - Icelandic uses Æ, but not Ø or Å. - Finnish uses Å, although it is viewed as a Swedish letter.\n- Norway uses thin, curved rectangular bollards with the reflector inside of a **black** parallelogram.\n- Norwegian snow poles are typically orange, with a **fairly** **thin** white reflector. The reflector is normally toward the **middle** of the pole. NOTE: Swedish snow poles typically have a wider reflector slightly higher up, and Finnish snow poles have their reflector at the very top.\n- It is also fairly common to find thin **wooden** snow poles with painted reflectors. NOTE: While wooden snow poles can be found in other Nordic countries, they will typically not have reflectors.\n- Guardrails often have **wooden posts**. NOTE: This is not common in Sweden or Finland.\n- Norwegian pedestrian signs typically have **four stripes** and a very simply drawn person. Note however, that there is a version with five stripes and a version where the person is more detailed and wearing a hat. NOTE: While Finnish pedestrian signs have five stripes, Swedish pedestrian signs have four stripes. However, the person on Swedish signs is detailed, but without a hat.\n- Norwegian directional signs are **yellow** with a **black border**. You will commonly see the road number displayed, either in a green box for European highways and major roads, or in a white box, for smaller roads.\n- On smaller roads, it is common to see these blue signs with a **large white M**. NOTE: Similar signs can be found in Sweden, however the font is distinctly different. The middle point of the M does not extend to the bottom of the letter. There are no similar signs in Finland.\n- Norwegian bus stops usually have this small, **blue sign** with a white bus. NOTE: Sweden has a lot of different bus stops, none of which look like this.\n- **White signs** with the text “**Sone**”, generally featuring a speed limit, are common in urban areas.\n- The most common street name suffixes in Norway are **vei** and **gate**. While attached to the name, they take the forms -veien and -gata or -gate. NOTE: Swedish street names use the suffixes väg or vägen and gata or gatan, where gata is always detached from the name. Danish uses vej and gade.\n- Street signs will generally be **centred** on top of sign posts. NOTE: Street signs in Sweden will normally be attached either to the side of sign posts or lamp posts.\n- Norwegian traffic signs have a red outline and a **white background**. NOTE: Both Swedish and Finnish road signs have a yellow background.\n- You can also find these road construction signs, with a **bright yellow** background.\n- Most smaller road signs will be attached with four visible **sign bolts** in the shape of a tall rectangle. Beware that you may occasionally find framed signs instead, particularly in urban settings.\n- Norway uses **yellow on black** chevrons.\n- Small **white square signs**, displaying the road number on top, and the distance to the closest town, are common to see along medium sized roads. The road number will be preceded either by an R or an F. F roads show up as Fv on the map and are generally difficult to locate, while R roads lack any letters on the map and are generally more findable.\n- Norwegian poles are normally **wooden** and often have a small black metal cap on the top. NOTE: This metal cap is also common in both Sweden and Finland.\n- Lamps attached to wooden poles in Norway are normally mounted to the pole with a **thick single bolting**. NOTE: Sweden and Finland use double bolting.\n- Traditional houses in Norway commonly have **grass covered roofs**. NOTE: This is far less common in Sweden and Finland.\n- Norway has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Northern Europe also has smallcam."

There are also a small number of roads beginning with a 9: Road 9, going north of Kristiansand, and a couple of two-digit roads in the far north. NOTE: Regional roads starting with “Fv” do not follow this pattern.\n- Bilingual signs with **Sámi** can be found in several northern areas in Norway. While the Sámi languages are very different from Norwegian, the best way to recognize them are the letters Á, Đ and the use of several vowels in a row, something which is uncommon in Norwegian. Note that not all signs in these areas will be bilingual.\n- This species of fern (Pteridium aquilinum, also known as bracken) which typically has a fairly tall stem and many wide leafs branching out, is mostly found in the south of Norway. Beware that other species of ferns can be found further north.\n- **Spruces** are mainly found in the southern half of the country, particularly in the southeast and around Trondheim.\n- **Pines** are most common in coastal and far inland areas in the southern half of the country.\n- **Oaks** are mainly found in the far south of Norway.\n- **Maples** are mainly found in the south, particularly by the farmlands around Oslo.\n- **Brightly coloured moss** is common to find in the area between Lillehammer and Oppdal.\n- Large farmlands are mainly found in **three areas**, the southeast, the area surrounding Trondheim, and south of Stavanger. _The following clues will explain how to differentiate between the three._\n- The largest concentration of farmland is found in the southeast, in the general vicinity of Oslo. The area is **much flatter** than most of the country, and it is common to get a rolling landscape with smooth, round forested hills in the distance. The area southeast of Oslo is particularly flat.\n- The farmlands surrounding Trondheim are generally **very hilly**, and the hills are typically both steeper and more uneven than in the southeast.\n- Similarly to the southeast, the farmland south of Stavanger is flatter than most of the country. However, the fields look more **vast** and open, and it is very common to see **rock walls** made of large, round rocks. Furthermore, rather than crops, most fields will only contain grass.\n- While fjords can be found along most of the Norwegian coast, **deep fjords** surrounded by **tall mountains** are most common between Bergen and Trondheim.\n- Distinct, **sharp, rocky** mountains with few trees can be seen on the Lofoten Archipelago.\n- The northeast of Norway can typically be recognized by a somewhat **rolling landscape**, rather than tall mountains, and vegetation mainly consisting of very **small birches** combined with patched grass.\n- Barren highlands, with **no trees or bushes**, and often with rocky mountains along the road, are mostly found in the southwest.\n- **Exposed rock**, often spotted with small coastal pines and bushes, are mainly found on the south coast.\n- **Coastal grasslands** with little to no other vegetation and only somewhat low, distant mountains can be found by coastal roads in the far north.\n- While completely **white wooden houses** can be found in the entire country, they’re especially common on the southern coast, where you’ll commonly see entire villages made up of them.\n- **Black snow poles** are most commonly found between Bergen and Trondheim.\n- Small, **wide black pole plates**, with a single line of letters and digits, can be found in southeastern Norway.\n- **Rusty guardrails** are almost exclusively found in coastal regions, and particularly on the southern half of the west coast.\n- **Svalbard** is an unincorporated archipelago within the Norwegian Kingdom.

NOTE: The UAE and Qatar use similar signs.\n- Many signposts in Oman have **black-and-white stripes**. NOTE: Within the Middle East, striped signposts are only found in Oman and the UAE.\n- Oman typically uses wooden poles, which have pole tops consisting of three varying designs. The first two have 3 insulators, symmetrically attached to a horizontal metal bar. The design with the metal triangle above the wooden pole is unique to Oman. The third design has the insulators attached to the side. Poles in general are more common in Oman than in the UAE or Qatar.\n- Oman uses **black-and-yellow **chevrons that have an unusually large number of arrows.\n- High voltage pylons painted with a red and white pattern are common in Oman.

The south coast of Oman also rarely features some similar mountains.\n- Close to the southern coast, especially around Salalah, you will find a **rolling hills landscape**. The area commonly features rocky ground, bushes and small trees as well as some fairly green valleys.\n- The mountains north of Nizwa have an amount of **green bushes** that are unusually large for the north. The mountains are very rocky and jagged, which differentiates them from the more rolling mountains in the south.\n- Sandy desert with light coloured green and yellow shrubs can be found in northeastern Oman, mainly south and west of Bidiyah.\n- South of Bidiyah you can find a couple of dirt roads going through a slightly rolling landscape consisting of orange-pink sand and small yellow-ish shrubs. The roads mainly go between long and low sand dunes with a general south-south-west direction.\n- Salalah is located on a flat coastal plain with rolling mountains surrounding it to the north.\n- Masirah Island features a dry and slightly hilly landscape, typically with somewhat grey soil and with brown shrubs visible. Road 51, which circulates the island, usually only has a white centre road line, which can help in recognising it. The front camera on the island is slightly smudged.\n- **Acacia trees**, recognisable by their relatively short height and umbrella-like flat crowns, are most abundant and common in northern Oman, but can also be found close to the rest of the coast.\n- **Date palm plantations** are most common along the northern coast. NOTE: Coconut palms, on the other hand, are usually found near Salalah.\n- **Sandy dunes**, that usually look quite **red**, are found near the border with Saudi Arabia and further inland in the middle of Oman.\n- **Gas pipelines**, often paralleling the road, are most common around Fahud, in Ad Dhahirah Governorate. But they can also be found in many pockets in central-southern Oman.\n- You can use the colour of the bins in Oman to narrow down your location. The purple regions are mixed. NOTE: Even the dark blue and red regions are not 100% a certain colour.\n- Many bins have a set of numbers on them that can be used to always get the region. The first pair of numbers give away the governorate, and the second pair further divide the governorates into smaller subdivisions. NOTE: This map does not list every regional code.\n- Black bins with a black sticker on the front can be found in Al Buraimi, Ash Sharqiyah North, and Muscat Governorates.\n- Grey bins with a black sticker on the front are found in Ad Dhahirah Governorate.\n- Black bins with a white sticker are found in Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate, southern Dhofar Governorate, and Muscat Governorate.\n- Grey bins with a white sticker are commonly found in Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate, and sometimes in Dhofar Governorate.\n- Black bins without stickers are mainly found in Al Batinah South Governorate and north of Al Khaburah in Al Batinah North Governorate. NOTE: Black bins throughout Oman may appear like they lack stickers, so use this with caution.\n- Grey bins without a sticker on the front are found in Al Batinah North Governorate. NOTE: They can have a sticker on the side.\n- Western-style small black bins are found in Muscat and eastern Al Batinah North Governorate.\n- Bins in Muscat governorate often have white-and-red chevron-like stickers on the sides.\n- Regardless of colour, if the bins have a sticker on the side, you should be in one of the North Coast governorates.\n- A **regular-looking antenna** that **faces upwards** is mainly found around and west of Muscat, as well as on highways in the northwest.

In 2024 coverage, this meta overlaps with the more easily identified coil wire, and places you in either the far northeast, or west of Seeb. In 2025 coverage, it will place you in the general northeast quarter, muscat, or sohar.\n- If the **rusty nut** is on the right screw of the front left mounting bar connector, that places you in either central Oman, or Musandam Governorate, which is the northern exclave.  NOTE: The central part is generally flat, while Musandam is very mountainous.\n- If there are **two cut zip ties** on the left side of the bar/cable, it will place you in southern Dhofar, western Al Wusta*, or more rarely in the north around Sinaw or Nizwa.  See below hint*\n- All the Al Wusta ‘2 cut zip tie coverage,’ which is located northwest of Haima, has a **third zip tie** on the **right side**, which is uncut.\n- This **small stripe** on the **bottom left corner of the roof**, places you either west of Nizwa, or to the northeast between Nizwa and Seeb. NOTE: The stripe is more clear in the coverage between Nizwa and Seeb.\n- A dirty **roof covered in small black specks** means you are in western Al Wusta Governorate between the 39 and 31 yellow roads.\n- A **faint orange speck** on the **middle left** side of the roof places you west or northwest of Ibri.\n- Similar to the last hint, if the stain is on the** bottom-left** of the roof, it places you in Al Wusta Governorate. Either southeast of Haima, or the east coast.\n- If the edge of the roof is stained with distinct **short stripes**, with a gap between each one, you are likely in southeastern Ad Dakhiliyah ‍Governorate, or over the eastern border.\n- A **water bottle** in the truck bed places you northeast of the Oman label, in Al Wusta Governorate.  NOTE: If the water bottle is on the right side, you are likely near the eastern extent of coverage.\n- This** brown splatter stain** on the roof means you are around Sohar.

Other mountains are also visible to the north and west.\n- In and close to Adam, the coverage is usually quite hazy, and the ridge and hills from the previous tip can be seen to the north. Though sometimes, only one or two are visible. Unlike north of Adam, you won’t see mountains in any other direction.\n- Around the town of Ubar, you can find patches of green agricultural land surrounded by desert.\n- **Oil drills** are common around Amal and sometimes seen along Road 39. As well as northwest of Fahud, in Ad Dhahirah Governorate.\n- If you are surrounded by mountains on all sides, and you are in a somewhat urban area, you are likely just southeast of Muscat, in Al Amarat.\n- The **bumpy **and **sloped ridge of hills** combined with all the **pipes **and other** oil related infrastructure** makes the town of Fahud very distinct.\n- Most of the coverage in the Musandam Governorate exclave is coastal, with rocky cliffs usually hugging the road. A majority, but not all, of this coverage will have the coast to the west, excluding any other roads in the country with a similar look.\n- The road going to Saudi Arabia from Ibri can be recognised by the completely flat desert landscape with bright pink-greyish soil along with the road having** very wide shoulders** and the overall great road condition. The southern portion goes in a straight northeast direction, and the northern section curves more and can have more shrubs.\n- Similar to the previous road, the road west of Fahud goes through a flat desert with pink-greyish soil. The main difference is that the road itself is in poor shape and without roadlines as well as the direction of the road being southeast.\n- Road 29 south of Ibri features a fairly shrubby landscape, with low and jagged mountains on the eastern side of the road. The** low-lying sun** to the northwest is particularly distinct.\n- The southern section of Road 29 only has a **middle white line**, which along with the greyish and sandy desert landscape makes this road unique.\n- This long stretch of Road 31 can be recognised by the light-coloured flat desert landscape along with the **wide shoulders** and the often faded road lines. The weather is usually somewhat cloudy.\n- The divided section of Road 31 is the only divided road going through a flat desert landscape.\n- Road 32 north of Duqm travels through a **hilly **desert landscape, in a general northern direction.\n- Crossing into the Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate, the shoulders become **wide**, like those on Road 31. However, unlike Road 31, the desert here is darker and has more shrubs and greenery. A long portion of the road also has overcast coverage. The lighter red section is no longer road 32 but still features the wide shoulders. The landscape further north also gets hillier and more vegetated.\n- Road 35 is surrounded by hills and mountains, and the ground is mostly **covered in green shrubs. **Curved lamp posts are posted at regular intervals on the northeastern side of the road.\n- Road 37 travels in a generally northwest direction through a very generic, flat desert landscape. The angle is one of the best clues for this road. On the southern half, a big power line is visible to the northeast, while on the northern half, you can find distinct sunset coverage.\n- Road 39 is also one of the more generic roads. Probably the best way to recognise it are the **narrow**, or even **non-existent shoulders**. The western parts can get quite hilly, but overall, the desert landscape is flat.\n- Coastal Road 41 features one of the sandiest landscapes in Oman, with very light sand all around. The coast is sometimes visible in the distance. On the north-to-south stretch, you can see a distant ridge to the west.\n- The western stretch of Road 41 has wide shoulders similar to Road 31, however, the more northwest-bound angle along with the reddish soil should tell them apart. The eastern half has cloudy coverage.\n- Road 42/49 east of Salalah is a scenic coastal road that features a lot of** light-coloured tall rocky cliffs**. The coast is also often visible.\n- Just south of Shalim, you’ll find a stretch of** overcast** coverage, along with a power line to the west of the road, but only north of the plateau.\n- North of Shalim Road 42 turns into a **very wide unpaved road**, with the soil being quite light in colour. You’ll sometimes see oil drills in the distance along this stretch.\n- The road southeast of Ubar has a general northwest bound angle, along with a power line to the left of the road. You will often see signs of life in the form of farms or buildings on this road. NOTE: Don’t mix this up with the 37, which has a similar angle, but is more desolate and can have sunset coverage.\n- Road 43, also south of Ubar, is unpaved and features** sunset coverage** along with a dust trail behind the car.\n- The unlabelled road northwest of Ubar can be recognised by the small white markings between the dashes.\n- Just west of ميتان, only labelled in Arabic on Google Maps, literally translating to methane, there is a stretch of road, which has a uniquely light-coloured pavement. To the north, you can see sand dunes.\n- Roads 45 and the western stretch of 39 both feature a similar slightly hilly desert landscape, sunny weather, and a general east-to-west direction. What makes them unique is the** ****light-coloured shoulders**** **the roads share, though it is most pronounced on Road 45. The roads also mostly have a faded white middle line. To tell the 45 and western 39 apart, look at the sun, which is overhead on the 39, but to the west on 45. The section north of Mudayy is also the 45, but unlabelled on Google Maps."

While the mosque itself isn’t visible from all of the coverage, the minarets can be seen from most spots.\n- In Pākpattan you can find a **busy market street** with a roof made of rugs. NOTE: Like the car coverage in Lahore, this, and the rest of the coverage in Pākpattan, is hidden coverage.\n- Just west of the market street in Pākpattan you can find a very **busy-looking** urban street.\n- You can also find this **narrow alleyway** in Pākpattan, just north of the market street.\n- Rohtas Fort, west of Jhelum, can typically be recognised by the almost **black fortress walls**. While the walls aren’t always nearby, they can usually be seen in the distance.\n- The coverage in Katas, north of Sargodha, can be recognised by the hazy sky combined with the **hilliness**.\n- Patriata, northeast of Islamabad can be recognised by the **hilly forests**, mainly consisting of **tall pine trees**. Interestingly, parts of the coverage were taken from an aerial lift.\n- The coverage in Changa Manga Forest Park can be recognised by the path angle being northeastern, and the narrow channel closely following the path, either on the northern or southern side."

NOTE: Within South America, yellow licence plates are **only** found in Peru, Colombia and rarely, Chile.\n- In Gen 3 coverage, Peru uses a solid **black** or **white** Google car. NOTE: In South America, these two cars are limited to the following countries: - The black Google car is only found in Peru, Argentina and Uruguay. - The white Google car is only found in Peru, Bolivia and Chile.\n- An important thing to note is that Peru has **Generation 4** Street View coverage, whereas the neighbouring country of Bolivia does not. While Ecuador does have some Generation 4 coverage, it will always have a large pickup truck.\n- Peru also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. NOTE: Peru, Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries with smallcam.\n- Peruvian roads always have white outer lines. On highways, you will find either **single yellow dashed** or **double yellow** middle lines. On rural mountain roads, you will most likely see white outer lines without any centre line. On divided highways, the road lines may be completely white in colour. NOTE: In the continent of South America, rural mountain roads, with the features mentioned above, are predominantly found in Peru.\n- Peru is the only South American country to use **black-and-white** striped signposts.

NOTE: Uruguay sometimes uses black-and-white posts for its traffic lights, but not for road signs.\n- Bollards in Peru are painted red or yellow, and the country mainly uses a variety of **triangular-shaped** concrete bollards. Occasionally you will also spot other designs, such as these circular concrete variants.\n- **Black-and-yellow** stripes on guardrails are seen throughout the country. You might sometimes find different designs, such as this sharp arrow design. NOTE: Similar striped guardrails are also found in Bolivia. To differentiate them, just have a look at the outer stripe. Peru uses a black one, while Bolivia features a yellow one.\n- Kilometre markers in Peru are made out of concrete and are painted black and white. NOTE: When entering and leaving urban areas, the markers will sometimes feature the road number.\n- Peruvian metal signposts feature **concrete blocks** at the bottom. NOTE: Within South America, Peru is the only country to do so.\n- The country uses a variety of poles. They are made out of either **concrete** **or** **wood**, and sometimes feature distinct horizontal concrete bars. NOTE: Horizontal concrete bars are also found in Argentina.\n- Some poles in Peru have **painted bottom sections**. Most commonly they will be black or black-and-yellow. NOTE: This pattern of pole paint is unique to Peru within South America, however, similar ones can be seen in other South American countries, such as Colombia.\n- Bridges in Peru are commonly painted **orange**.\n- Peru largely consists of semi-arid mountain ranges and valleys.\n- **Tuk tuks**, called mototaxis in Peru, are frequently seen in the country, especially in major cities such as Lima, Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, and Iquitos.\n- **Wide red and white stickers** will typically be attached to the side of taxis and commercial vehicles. NOTE: While less common, these can be found in some neighbouring countries.\n- Peruvian **electricity counters** have a unique design: They are rectangular, metallic, and typically feature two or three horizontal slits.\n- **Sol** is the currency of Peru.

However, an exception is the often flat desert near Piura in the northwest. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Peru has a diverse climate, dominated by a **dry desert** in the west, and a **tropical rainforest** in the east. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Highways in Peru are mainly located in the west, and the numbers increase from north to south. The 1, 3 and 5 are the longest and traverse through multiple departments. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- These three landscapes are typically found along offroads in Tumbes. You will always see sandy soil with either **green or withered bushes**. NOTE: In addition, Tumbes does not have black cars on off roads. Make sure to consider it whenever you see such landscapes with a white Street View car.\n- The southwestern landscape of Piura is generally dry, featuring a **low amount of vegetation** with a few shrubs and bushes. The landscape is mostly flat, but you will sometimes see rolling hills.\n- Northwest of the city of Piura lies an area with similar vegetation to the area mentioned previously. However, this area is **noticeably hillier**.\n- **Coconut palms** (and other species of tall palms) can sometimes be seen in coastal areas of Peru, mainly north of Lima. They are mainly found in the agricultural areas which are typically found around the major coastal cities.\n- **Olive tree plantations** can be found in the far southern region of Tacna.\n- Most of the **sugar cane** production is found in the northern coastal regions of Peru near the cities of Chiclayo and Trujillo. Typically you see **large fields** of sugar cane in these areas. Smaller areas of sugar cane can be found further south in other valleys close to the Pacific coast.\n- Similarly to sugar cane plants, **banana plants** are generally found in agricultural regions adjacent to the coast in the northern half of the country.\n- A** flat landscape** in the mountains of Peru is usually seen in central Puno and around Lake Chinchaycocha. NOTE: This landscape might look similar to Bolivia. Make sure to look out for other clues before guessing.\n- Low grass, a few hills, stone walls in villages and brown brick buildings are typical for the region south of **Lake Titicaca** in eastern Peru.\n- Far north Peru features mountains that are often covered in **shrubby trees and bushes**. Closer to the coast and the Ecuador border, these mountains are often quite dry in appearance.\n- **Pine plantations** are typically** **found in higher elevation areas of the country, away from the coastal deserts and Amazonian Regions. The most common types of pine trees planted are Pinus radiata and Pinus patula.\n- The areas adjacent to the northern Amazonian city of Tarapoto feature **moderately tall foliage-covered mountains** and can bear a similar resemblance to the hilly areas of Colombia or Brazil.\n- In higher elevation areas near the centre of the country, **exposed rocky outcroppings** are commonly seen in the sides of hills and mountains. Some areas with the highest concentrations are near Lago Chinchaycocha (Junin District) stretching south towards the city of Ayacucho. NOTE: Exposed rocks can rarely be seen anywhere in the country, so use this meta with some caution.\n- Similarly, taller mountains near the middle of the country often feature **rocky and sharp mountain tops**. The main region of these mountains stretches from near the city of Huaraz southward to the city of Cusco; generally away from the coast.\n- Patches of **light green ****lichen** can be seen covering rocks and growing on the ground in high elevation areas of central and southern Peru.\n- **Dark red-tinted soil** is found in several areas of Peru. Some notable areas include the areas near Cusco and Ayacucho in the south of the country, as well as areas near the northern cities of Cajamarca and Tarapoto. It can be found to a lesser extent in adjacent regions.\n- Areas near the cities of Ica, Arequipa, and Tacna feature** barren and mostly flat desert landscapes** that can resemble areas of northern Chile. You can typically see mountains in the distance, primarily while looking to the east.\n- Coastal **agricultural valleys** in the middle and south are commonly sandwiched between **dry mountains with no vegetation**. The general orientation of these valleys are southwest-northeast. NOTE: Agricultural valleys in the north of Peru can look similar, but often feature more shrubs and trees on the mountains.\n- As a general rule, the closer you are to Lake Titicaca in Peru, houses and buildings made out of **red brick** become more common. This type of architecture resembles the predominant type of building seen in parts of western Bolivia, which is helpful for remembering where it is seen most commonly. Additionally, buildings with blue tinted glass can be seen most commonly in the same areas. NOTE: Red brick buildings can be seen anywhere in the country, so use other clues before guessing.\n- Buildings with **overhanging roofs with wooden supports** are mostly found in northern regions of Peru. These buildings are sometimes brightly coloured as well.\n- Tuk-Tuks with **open front compartments** are primarily found in the northern half of Peru, and are especially common in northern Amazonian adjacent regions. NOTE: This type of Tuk-Tuk can be found elsewhere to a lesser extent, so use other clues before guessing.\n- Lamp posts in Lima and Lima Department often have a distinct, sweeping curve at the top, resembling an **inverted \"J\" shape**. NOTE: This design can occasionally be found in other parts of the country, such as Iquitos and Pucallpa. For other, more specific patterns, please see this document.\n- This cylindrical bollard, with a **black and yellow stripe at the top**, is unique to the state of Moquegua, which is located in the south of Peru."

It features dense forest, few villages, and resembles interior areas of Brazil. Some of this area has been overwritten with Generation 4. Most of this segment runs north to south.\n- **Ruta 28B **between the towns of Kimbiri and Echarate is a paved road with very faded or missing road lines. It is also characterised by being a relatively small road with Generation 4 coverage, which hugs the hillside and is located next to a river valley.\n- The valley connecting the cities of Jauja and Huancayo features a flat plain with **plentiful trees, agricultural areas, and small villages**. North-south oriented mountains can be seen on both edges of the valley.\n- The coverage on the north side of Lake Titicaca was taken during a significantly wetter season than the coverage taken on the south side of Lake Titicaca.\n- North of the city of Huancayo lies a shallow lake called Lake Chinchaycocha (also referred to as ‘the middle lake.’). This lake is generally** marshy** and a **range of mountains** can be seen to the** east **of the lake.

It is an isolated city with only **Generation 3** Street View coverage. Three-wheeled tuk-tuks, overcast skies, and rolling Amazonian landscapes are commonly seen in the area. This coverage is isolated from other areas of northern Peru.\n- The southern city of Cusco is recognizable by its prevalence of both red brick and Spanish colonial style buildings. Cusco is surrounded by **mountains on all sides** and features an **airport in the middle of the city**. Due to its proximity and similar architecture, Cusco superficially resembles the Bolivian city of La Paz.\n- The city of Tacna in the far south of Peru has this distinct **dry** **ridge **to the north.\n- Within Peru, this **white** Street View car is found in central Cusco. It drives from the remote town of Aguas Calientes up to Machu Picchu.\n- A **train track** covered by a trekker is located between Aguas Calientes and Cusco."

NOTE: Newer electric vehicles have green plates.\n- Polish bollards have a **red strip** that wraps all the way around the bollard. This strip has a red reflector on the front (sometimes hard to see), and a white reflector on the back. Bollards sometimes have numbers on them. NOTE: The same design can be found in Zakarpattia Oblast in Ukraine.\n- Poland usually has thin concrete utility poles with see-through holes. They are commonly known as “**holey poles**”. The holes often do not extend all the way to the bottom of the pole. Sometimes, two poles are joined together, or put in an A-frame shape. You can also find round concrete poles. NOTE: Hungary and Romania also have holey poles, but these are wider and more bulky. In addition, the holes extend all the way to the bottom.\n- Poland has all-white road lines. **Double middle lines** are very common and usually a good clue for Poland. NOTE: Some other European countries, most notably Denmark and Greece, can have double middle lines.\n- Poland has **square (normal B-type) guardrails**, with circular red reflectors. NOTE: Poland is one of only a very few European countries with this type of guardrail. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- Warning signs are triangular and have a **yellow background** and a distinct **thin red border**. NOTE: In Europe, this combination of a yellow background with a thin red border is unique to Poland.\n- However, prohibitory signs are round and have a **white background** with a thicker red border.\n- Poland has a unique **pedestrian sign**. Instead of the usual zebra stripes, it just has a single horizontal line. NOTE: Austria and Belgium also have horizontal lines, but they use two lines instead of Poland’s single line.\n- Regular Polish direction signs have a **green background**. These signs use a distinct font, which is a good clue for Poland. NOTE: Signs on expressways have a blue background.\n- Poland has two **town entry signs**: a green one with the locality’s name, and a white-and-black one with a stylized urban area. NOTE: Like direction signs, town entry signs use a distinct font.\n- Polish chevrons are **white with red arrows**.\n- **Polish** is a Slavic language. In contrast to other slavic languages, the Polish alphabet includes: - Ł with a stroke through it (unique to Polish) - Ą and Ę with a small hook (also found in Lithuanian) - Ć, Ń, Ó, Ś, Ź with an acute accent. Of these, Ń is unique to Polish. In addition, the only other language with Ś and Ź is Montenegrin. - Ż with a small dot (unique to Polish) Polish is very consonant-heavy, with lots of consonant clusters. Polish does not use V. Instead, it uses W a lot, the only Slavic language to do so. Other unusually common consonants are the Z, K, and C.\n- Poland is generally a **flat country**, with occasional rolling hills. The country is very green, with a lot of agriculture, and some amount of forest cover. NOTE: Mountains can be found near the southern border.\n- Many roads in Poland are lined by **rows of trees**.\n- Neatly **tiled sidewalks** are very common in Poland. Tiles are often grey or light red. Occasionally, even roads have tiled pavement. Many different types of tile patterns occur, including larger square tiles.\n- **Polish architecture** is fairly similar to other Central European countries. Buildings usually have plain stone walls covered in light or pastel stucco. Frequent roofing colours are orange or red, black, and brown. Roof tiles and panes often have a tidy, almost plastic-like look. Some rural houses have corrugated sheet roofs similar to those often found in the Baltics. **Detached ****single family homes** are common throughout Poland. They sometimes have a blocky look. In bigger towns, **apartment buildings** are common. Many date from communist times, and some of them still have a somewhat austere look. However, many have been renovated and look nice and well-kept. **Downtown areas** are usually dense and often have historic buildings.\n- Poland is one of the most Catholic countries in Europe. You can often find **Christian shrines** on the side of roads.

Some exceptions also exist. NOTE: This tip only applies to 3-digit roads. Bigger roads with 2-digit road numbers mostly do not adhere to this geographic pattern.\n- Polish landline phone numbers have 9 digits. The first 2 digits are the **area code**. These area codes are distributed in a sensible manner across the country. Even just learning the first digit of the area codes can greatly narrow down the region. You can click on the infographic to enlarge it. NOTE: Mobile numbers also have 9 digits, but luckily there is no overlap between the first two digits of mobile numbers and landlines.\n- When it comes to Polish place names, the **-owo** ending is mostly limited to the northern half of the country, and the **-ów** ending mostly to the southern half. You may also encounter -ino or -yno, mainly in the northwest, and -ew near the centre of the country. NOTE: A good way to remember this is that Kraków is in the south of Poland, and most other towns ending in -ów are too.\n- While rare, bilingual signs can be found in the highlighted regions. - **Kashubian**, found in the north, is another West Slavic Language, featuring a lot of umlauts and accents. _Wszëtczi lëdze rodzą sã wòlny ë równy w swòji czëstnoce ë swòjich prawach.

Most plates have a **yellow strip** on the right, which is unique to Portugal.  The yellow strip was discontinued in 2020, so in Generation 4 coverage you may sometimes see plates with just the blue strip.\n- **Portuguese** is a Romance language that is closely related to Spanish. Unlike Spanish, Portuguese includes the letters Ç, Ã, Õ, Â, and Ê, while it does not include the letter Ñ, which is very common in Spanish. NOTE: You can also find Ç in Catalan.\n- **Eucalyptus trees** are very common in Portugal. The only other part of Europe where you’ll commonly see eucalyptus is northern Spain.\n- The Portuguese word for road is **‘Rua’**. NOTE: In Galician, the word for road is ‘Rúa’, with an accent on the ‘u’.\n- Concrete ladder poles, with very **tall ladder steps**, are common in Portugal. Each step often has a small see-through hole. NOTE: In Spain and France you will commonly see ladder poles with short steps.\n- **Hunting signs** with a red and white colour scheme are a common sight in rural areas. They are either diamond shaped or rectangular. NOTE: In contrast, Spanish hunting signs are white and black.\n- Portuguese bollards are either wedge-shaped with a noticeably thin white top, or flat with a wide reflector. While most reflectors will be white, you may also find orange reflectors. These are noticeably darker than the yellow reflectors in Spain.\n- Directional signs are generally white, with **black arrows** that are **not** touching the borders of the sign. NOTE: Spanish directional signs will typically feature the road number in colourful boxes and do not have a black arrow, other than a thin black border.\n- Most kilometre markers are wide rectangles with a **coloured section** on the left side divided diagonally from the white part. Every kilometre you will find a larger square sign with a coloured top half featuring the road number.\n- Black and white waystones can commonly be found in Portugal.\n- Stop signs in Portugal feature a fairly large font. NOTE: This is mostly useful to distinguish it from Spain, where stop signs have a distinctly small and compact font.\n- Portuguese chevrons are **black with yellow arrows**. NOTE: Portugal is the only Mediterranean country with this chevron colour scheme.\n- Pedestrian signs have **five stripes**, and the person is wearing a **belt**, which is noticeably high. NOTE: Spanish pedestrian signs have eight stripes, Italian signs don't have a belt and Greek signs have two dotted lines instead of stripes.\n- Portugal uses A-type guardrails with **red reflectors**. NOTE: This is mostly useful to tell apart Portugal and Spain, which uses yellow reflectors.\n- Portuguese road signs are typically encased by a **white border**. NOTE: Most Spanish signs don’t have a white border.\n- Cobblestone roads are very common in Portugal. These will typically be made of square cobblestones arranged **diagonally** compared to the road direction.\n- Similarly, cobblestone sidewalks made of distinctly **bright stones** are very common.\n- White painted stone houses with orange tiled roofs are extremely common in Portugal.\n- You’ll commonly see **blue or yellow lines** painted around windows and doors, as well as around the edges of walls.\n- Houses made of **decorative mosaic tiles** are somewhat common in Portugal.\n- Portugal has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front.

The round chimneys are a particularly strong clue.\n- Houses in northern Portugal are often made of **square concrete blocks**, which are commonly put together with white mortar. NOTE: Very similar architecture, but typically without the white mortar, is commonly found over the border in Galicia.\n- Open fields sparsely populated with **holm oaks** (Quercus ilex) and **cork oaks** (Quercus suber) are very common in the southeast. These species of oaks tend to be on the smaller side, and have a Mediterranean look. While these fields will look quite dry during summer and fall, they will look much lusher during spring.\n- **Olive plantations** are generally more common in the eastern half of the country, particularly in the far northeast and slight southeast. NOTE: The easiest way to tell apart the olive plantations from the oak fields from the last tip is to look at the pattern in which they’re planted. Olive plantations are typically planted in dense rows, while the oaks are planted more sparsely and not in an obvious pattern.\n- Dense **eucalyptus forests** are mostly found in the northwest.\n- Forests, or plantations of** Maritime pines **(Pinus Pinaster) are very common in the northern half of Portugal. You can recognize the tree by its grey bark with red undertones, and fluffy branches that point upwards. Older trees often don’t have any branches in the bottom half of the tree.

This will help distinguish Puerto Rico from other nearby Latin American countries and territories, where American stores are not common.\n- Front plates are **not mandatory** in Puerto Rico. Therefore, seeing cars with front plates is rare. This helps differentiate from Guam and Northern Mariana Islands.\n- A significant part of the coverage in rural Puerto Rico is taken on large **divided highways**.\n- Here is an example of what **highway shields** in Puerto Rico look like.

NOTE: Make sure not to get this confused with the Ghana car, which has tape on the front right bar.\n- Being a French Department, you will see **French infrastructure**, such as signs, bollards and poles.\n- Réunion is a mountainous volcanic island in the Indian Ocean on a similar latitude to Queensland, Australia. Most roads are along the coast, with lush green mountains visible close by. Vegetation consists of palms and ferns, pine trees at higher elevation, and flowering plants due to the island’s tropical savanna climate."

Learning the general regions with coverage will help you get those extra 10 points.\n- There are six distinct bus stop designs on Réunion: - Yellow - This is the most common type and can be found all over the island. It is usually accompanied by another bus stop, meaning you can get a good region guess if you see it on its own. - L Shaped - It can either be white, or an olive colour. It may also be in the form of a bus shelter. It is almost never accompanied by a yellow bus stop. - Pink - Rarely accompanied by a yellow bus stop. - Orange - Almost always accompanied by a yellow bus stop. - Green - Almost always accompanied by a yellow bus stop. - Red - Rarely accompanied by a yellow bus stop. This infographic shows where each one can be found. The list above is ranked by how common each one is found. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Sugarcane plantations** on Réunion can be found in two regions: the northeast and the southwest. The southwest is generally more built up and densely populated, meaning you will see more buildings or cars around.\n- Cilaos is a town inside a **caldera**.

Note that although a bridge appears on the map, the coverage was taken before the bridge was built, meaning you will not see the bridge.\n- Route du Volcan can be recognized by the **Martian** landscape. The only vegetation is scattered shrubs and the soil is a distinct **brown-red** colour. These white stones lining the road are also a good clue.\n- La Route Forestière 58 de la Scierie et du Haut des Makes is a **winding dirt track** that can be recognized by the **dense vegetation** surrounding it, particularly pine trees and eucalyptus. The track itself is also dark in colour, with grass growing in the middle of it.\n- The eastern region of Réunion is the least densely populated, evident by the eastern part of the N2, which is a single carriageway passing through somewhat dense vegetation on both sides, or a vast landscape with little to no trees.\n- The two largest towns in Réunion can be differentiated by their **bollards**, commonly seen at intersections. Saint Paul uses black bollards, while Saint Denis uses green bollards, often with white balls on top. Saint Denis is also more built up, being the capital."

                "description": "- Birch trees, identified by their white peeling bark, have a wide range in Russia. Notably they are almost never found far south or far north in the western part of the country.\n- Birches very close together, as well as forests consisting of **only birches**, are indicative of areas east of the Urals, most commonly between Chelyabinsk Oblast and Novosibirsk Oblast.\n- Siberian larches are one of the dominant tree species in much of eastern Russia, recognized by their unique **needle-like leaves**. Generally speaking, they become more prevalent the further east you go in the country, as well as at high elevations.\n- Giant butterbur (commonly referred to as Sakhalin cabbage) is very common in Sakhalin Oblast, particularly in the southern half. Related plants can very rarely be found in Adygea.\n- This type of white flower (heracleum sosnowskyi) is most commonly found around Moscow, Komi Republic, and Perm Krai.\n- Large amounts of the pink or red flower fireweed (Chamaenerion angustifolium) typically indicates a northern region of Russia. Similarly, most places north of Moscow commonly have fireweed.\n- **Sunflowers **are common along the border with Ukraine as well as more eastern oblasts like Ulyanovsk, Samara, and northern Orenburg.\n- Blue-pod lupines appear very commonly in northern Vladimir Oblast, eastern Ivanovo Oblast, and southwestern Kostroma Oblast. It can also be found less commonly elsewhere in Kirov Oblast and towards the Baltics.\n- The **black poplar** is commonly found south, near the border with Ukraine, as well as toward the western border with Kazakhstan.\n- The Russian olive is typically found along the Kazakhstan border.\n- **Lined oak trees**, often with a single white stripe around the trunk, are extremely common in Kaliningrad.\n- Sparsely **planted larches** along the road with open rolling fields is common in Tatarstan and adjacent federal subjects.\n- **Sandy roadsides** are common in Khanty-Mansi and Yamalo-Nenets and adjacent subjects, as well as areas around Nizhny Novgorod on the Volga river. Other notable areas are Karelia, Murmansk, and western Sakha. Beware, however, that sandy roadsides can less commonly be found near rivers in other regions.\n- **Red soil** is common in the highlighted areas, notably around Izhevsk and Perm, much of Arkhangelsk Oblast, Leningrad Oblast, and Pskov Oblast, and near Volgograd and Astrakhan. Note that this map is by no means exhaustive; red soil can be found almost anywhere in the country near water or iron mines.\n- The Kamchatka peninsula has unique **grey gravelly soil**, as well as the largest number of **volcanoes** of any region in Russia. They are frequently seen across the peninsula, and in some places can appear quite close such as in Klyuchi.\n- Extremely gravelly and sometimes dark soil appears as you approach the mountains east of Yakutsk, starting around Keskil.\n- **Lush** and diverse forests in a **hilly** landscape characterises the noticeably warmer region around Vladivostok. Most of the coverage is overcast and has a white car with a long antenna. Further south, near the tri-border, you will find a more open rolling hill landscape.\n- The eastern half of the Kolyma Highway going to Magadan features a lot of tall **hills** and **mountains**, usually shrouded in a **haze**. Most of the roads are unpaved and feature **dark gravelly soil**. The haze is not present in the western half.\n- A presence of Siberian larches and large mountains on a mostly paved, but sometimes wide-gravel road indicates the main road south of Yakutsk, with Generation 4 white car appearing north of Berkakit.\n- Very **hazy coverage** is found east and south of Mirny, especially along the Vilyuy river. The colour of the haze varies, but it is often orange or white.\n- The landscape in Buryatia is very unique, containing open grassy landscape with shrubs and mountains. It is lusher near Baikal, but the mountains persist.\n- This **forest fire haze** is found near Lake Gusinoye, southwest of Ulan-Ude in Buryatia. While similar to the haze found near Mirny, the Buryatia haze coverage can typically be recognised by the **open rolling landscape**, which is not found near Mirny.\n- The main road of Altai Republic has a black car long antenna driving north **through the Altai Mountains**, often with **foggy or rainy** coverage.\n- **Dry steppe mountains** with a long antenna will usually indicate the Tuva Republic. The south part of the main road in the Altai Republic and Tuva can appear similarly dry, so things such as driving direction and cloudiness can be used to distinguish them.\n- The landscape in the far north can be recognised by the relatively **flat** landscape, with **very low vegetation**.\n- The coverage in Omsk Oblast is some of the most recognizable in Russia. It is typically summer Generation 4 and has a distinct landscape consisting of green agricultural fields, which are interrupted by isolated patches of (primarily) birch forest. Note that in Generation 3, this landscape can be seen in a much larger area of Russia. NOTE: This combination of coverage and landscape spills over slightly into the neighbouring Tyumen and Novosibirsk Oblasts (in the south, and near Tatarsk, respectively).\n- The area west of the Caspian Sea can often be recognised by its extremely **dry and flat landscape**, especially in Kalmykia, Astrakhan Oblast, and Dagestan.\n- **Grassy fields**, with **bushy vegetation**, in early spring Generation 4 coverage is typical for Dagestan. The landscape can either be completely flat or mountainous. These flowers are also quite common in the Generation 4 Dagestan coverage.\n- The **Caucasus mountain range** is one of the largest mountain ranges in Russia. The tallest mountain in Russia, Mount Elbrus, can be found on the border of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and Karachay-Cherkessia.\n- **Rocks** along the road are extremely common throughout most of Karelia and Murmansk Oblast. They can also be found in Perm Krai and Buryatia but are less common and smaller in size.\n- An open, hilly landscape with low shrubbery and fireweed usually indicates Murmansk. The lower the shrubbery, the more north it generally is.\n- This is a map of Russian **area codes**. Notably, area codes starting with 8 are in the west, codes starting with 3 are fairly central and codes starting with 4 are either east or around Moscow.\n- In Generation 3 coverage you will somewhat commonly find unblurred licence plates, featuring a **regional code** on the right side. The codes are generally ordered alphabetically within each type of federal subject, starting at republics and ending with autonomous okrugs. Therefore, the Republic of Adygea will be represented by 01, and the Amur Oblast by 28, both being the first alphabetical subjects of republics and oblasts respectively. If you encounter a three digit code, the second and third digit will form the regional code, in this case 123 becomes 23, for Krasnodar Krai. You may also find the codes written out on the back of trucks and vans.\n- These are the bus stops unique to specific federal subjects in Russia. Notably common and memorable ones include Krasnoyarsk Krai, Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and Mari El Republic.\n- Japanese-made cars with the **steering wheel on the right** become more common the further east you go, generally starting around Novosibirsk.\n- Russian bollards that appear very thin and attached to a stick are usually found in the eastern part of the country, starting around Omsk. Note that ordinary Russian bollards are still plentiful in this part of the country.\n- This **black traffic sign bottom** is primarily found in Stavropol and Chechnya, as well as western Dagestan. Rarely, exceptions can be found in other southern federal subjects such as Kabardino Balkaria, but these will typically be uncolored.\n- **Clips** on edges of signposts are found in Leningrad and St. Petersburg, and very rarely in Pskov, Novgorod or elsewhere.\n- **Outer dashed road lines** are usually found throughout Kursk Oblast. An exception can be found in Tuva Republic. Rarer exceptions include the Republic of Karelia, Primorsky Krai and Khabarovsk Krai.\n- As you go further north in Russia, some roads are made out of several **concrete blocks**. It is notably common in the Komi Republic, Nenets, and Yamalo-Nenets.\n- These **alternating red and white** poles are mainly found in Ulyanovsk city, but also less commonly in the greater Nizhny Novgorod area as well as somewhat randomly elsewhere in the country.\n- These **striped red and white** poles are found mostly in Saransk, but also in a few other cities in Mordovia.\n- Some republics of Russia with minority languages use bilingual town entry and directional signs, such as in Bashkortostan and Tatarstan displaying Bashkir and Tatar respectively.\n- **Town names** written in both the Cyrillic and **Latin** alphabets are common near the Baltic border and around Moscow, and to a lesser extent in federal subjects on the Finnish border.\n- These **brown signs**, pointing to typical tourist attractions, are common in Moscow Oblast and the oblasts bordering it. However, they can also less commonly be seen in city centres or near tourist attractions of other regions.\n- Buildings made of **white limestone brick** are indicative of Dagestan, as well as adjacent regions.\n- Buildings built almost entirely of **red brick** are mostly found south, but other notable exceptions include Magnitogorsk, Orsk, and Omsk.\n- While mosques can be found everywhere in Russia, they are by far most common in areas with a Muslim majority, mainly in much of south Russia as well as Tatarstan and Bashkortostan.\n- Historical buildings in Mari El often have a unique architecture style. You will frequently see design patterns that include green roofs, red brick sprinkled with white stone details. Local churches commonly feature a similar style.\n- This is the full coverage map of Russia. It can be helpful to know areas where there isn’t any coverage. The coverage is notably very sparse in the east and north. You can check out the extent of the official coverage on this website.\n- White car long antenna is found in many places, most commonly in southern Chelyabinsk, on snow coverage around Novosibirsk, and in the Far East beginning in Amur Oblast. NOTE: While Kamchatka technically has a silver car (with a B type antenna), it often appears white and is part of the small group of exceptions to black and white.\n- The A-type short antenna has its highest ridge on the right. Notable areas for this antenna are around Kaluga, Orenburg, and Krasnodar.\n- The B-type short antenna has its highest ridge on the left. This antenna is wide-ranging, but it is most notably found near Nizhny Novgorod, Elista, and Yekaterinburg and Tyumen.\n- The B-type pronounced antenna is the same as the B-type antenna but the ridge is more “rectangular”. This antenna is fairly limited, only being found commonly in Moscow Oblast, Kurgan Oblast, near Krasnoyarsk, and southwest Krasnodar.\n- The C-type short antenna can be thought of as a low A-type or a “twisting antenna” with the ridges being further from the top. It is found north and east of Moscow, with the furthest south being Rostov Oblast.\n- The blurred short antenna is visibly blurrier than any of the other short antennas. It is mainly found in two major clusters around Ufa and from Stavropol to Makhachkala.\n- The A-type long antenna has its highest ridge on the right side. Notable areas include Leningrad Oblast, Republic of Karelia, and Vologda Oblast. Almost all the white car long antenna coverage is A-type, so checking for A-type can also help confirm car colour.\n- The B-type long antenna has its highest ridge on the left side. Notable areas include Yaroslav to Vladimir, Tula Oblast, and much of the coverage near Tuva and Irkutsk. NOTE: There are two other long antenna types, referred to as CA and CB, but due to their relative lack of usefulness they will not be covered here.\n- Blurred long antenna is visibly blurrier than other long antenna cars, and is a strong clue for Sakhalin and various roads in the east, as well as much of Khanty-Mansi. On the other end there exists a blurred antenna in far western Bryansk Oblast and some of Tula Oblast.\n- The tilted short antenna is visibly tilted to the left and can be found primarily on a diagonal from St. Petersburg down to Volgograd, with exceptions in Stavropol and Ufa. Since the ridge is on the same side, it can sometimes appear as the A-type short antenna.\n- A large, red brake light is common in Kaliningrad, however it can also be found in some older coverage in western Russia.\n- Autumn Generation 3 coverage is common in Kaliningrad, Bryansk, Tula, and Belgorod in western Russia, but Kaliningrad only has autumn coverage.\n- **Generation 4** coverage is quite extensive and is found in most federal subjects in the country. Notably, areas like the Altai mountains and most of the Far East lack Generation 4 completely. Knowing where Generation 4 can be found isn’t the most helpful at the beginner level; other clues like season and car are more important. The dark red signifies areas where all of the coverage is Generation 4.\n- Winter Generation 4 is most common in the south of Russia, ranging from Ryazan all the way down to Kabardino-Balkaria and Dagestan. Winter can appear differently depending on the month (and even time of month the coverage was taken) which can be used to further regionguess.\n- Spring Generation 4 is common in several distinct places, such as around Kemerovo and Krasnoyarsk, Orenburg and Kamyshin, around Lipetsk, and in Moscow city. Differentiating these places typically comes down to landscape, as they tend to be fairly distinct.\n- Summer Generation 4 is the most common coverage in generation 4. It is pretty much everywhere except in the south and some of the east, but can be further subdivided by car colour.\n- Autumn Generation 4 is quite rare and only found around Kazan and a few roads in Murmansk, as well as some of Ulan-Ude.\n- Generation 4 red car is the most common generation 4 car meta, found primarily east around Khanty-Mansi, as well as along the main highways down to Irkutsk and Ulan-Ude. There is also a sizable patch near Penza and Tatarstan, as well as Rostov-on-Don.\n- Generation 4 white car is found in the May coverage near Lipetsk, in Moscow city, and most notably across all the coverage north of Berkatit in the Sakha Republic and Magadan.\n- Generation 4 black car is found mostly near Moscow, Tver, and Voronezh, with some also existing in Tatarstan and less commonly in the south."

NOTE: Expressways each have a **three-letter code** (e.g. TPE), making them easy to spot on signs.\n- Road signs in Singapore are unique in that they are always set on a **square white background**. NOTE: Road signs in almost all other countries will not have this square background.\n- **Rain trees** are seen all around Singapore, and are often planted along main roads.\n- Warnings are often written **on the road** in large letters, such as the famous “HUMP AHEAD”.\n- Singaporean buses are mostly **lime-green**, making them easily recognisable. Other designs can also be found, for example the white-and-purple SBS Transit variants.\n- Moreover, all bus stops are protected by **concrete bollards** with unique black-and-yellow **warning bands**. NOTE: Similar, but not quite identical designs are found in some Malaysian cities.\n- In addition to the concrete bollards on bus stops, Singapore sometimes has a unique and yellow **bus-leaving box** with an **arrow** on the street.\n- Almost all Singaporean traffic lights follow this design and are supported by a curved **sheet of metal** containing several **holes**."

The exact shape of the base may vary.\n- It is common in both Slovakia and Czechia to see temporary square sign posts coated in red and white stripes.\n- Slovak and Czech chevrons are **white** with **red arrows**. Less commonly, you may find red on yellow chevrons.\n- Stripy gas and water poles reminiscent of snow poles can often be found next to the road. NOTE: Dozens of poles of various utilities all over Europe use stripy patterns. Consider the location of the pole, as well as other clues before making a guess.\n- Hiking markers, made up of one colourful strip between two white ones, are commonly found in Slovakia and Czechia. They sometimes form an arrow. NOTE: While by far being the most common in Slovakia and Czechia, similar signs can be found in other European countries such as Poland, Hungary and Germany.\n- Like all of the former Eastern bloc, prefabricated panel apartment buildings are a common sight in urban areas. What distinguishes Slovakia and Czechia is the relatively good maintenance often combined with vibrant colours and patterns. Some smaller buildings also adhere to this style. NOTE: To a lesser extent, you can find this kind of architecture in neighbouring countries, like Poland and Hungary.\n- Roofs with **diamond shaped tiles** are common in both Slovakia and Czechia. NOTE: This is also somewhat common in Hungary.\n- A car antenna with a **grey** piece of **tape** stuck to the top can be seen on much of the Generation 3 coverage. NOTE: This can also be seen in Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria.\n- A black generation 4 Google car can also be found in both Slovakia and Czechia. NOTE: A black car can be found in many other European countries too.\n- A red generation 4 Google car can be found in both Slovakia and Czechia. NOTE: A red car can be found in other European countries too.\n- These **black **signs can often be found by the end of bridges in Generation 4 coverage. The road number is displayed on the left.\n- Slovak and Czech are mutually intelligible Slavic languages with several similarities such as acute accents above vowels (á, é, í, ó, ú, ý). However, they both have some distinct letters: - Slovak uses the letters **Ľ**, **Ô**, **Ä**, **Ŕ** and **Ĺ**; - Czech uses the letters Ř, Ě and Ů. NOTE: Acute accents on vowels are not found in South Slavic languages.\n- The Slovak landscape varies between very mountainous and completely flat. Generally speaking, Czechia is hillier, but less mountainous.\n- Slovakia uses blue directional signs, with **small** **white arrows**. NOTE: Czechia has large filled in white arrows instead.\n- Slovak road signs commonly have the painted sign border right **at the edge** of the sign. NOTE: The borders on Czech signs are almost always separated from the edge of the sign by a strip in the signs background colour.\n- Slovak highway signs can be either blue or green, and have a white border right **at the edge** of the sign. NOTE: The borders of Czech highway signs are separated from the edge.\n- White street signs with **blue text** and a **thin red border** are by far the most common in Slovakia. NOTE: The same design can also be found in Czechia, near the Slovak border. However, Czech street names **never** feature the word “ulica”.\n- House numbers in Slovakia are typically written on **white signs **with a thin red or black border.\n- The top of Slovak sign posts are typically either open, have a grey metal cap or a thin black cap. NOTE: Most Czech sign posts have a thick black cap.\n- Slovakia uses two major pedestrian signs, both having five stripes. The first has a simply drawn person with a belt, and the second has the stripes very close together. NOTE: The same belted design is found in Germany. A similar design, with a distinctly lower belt, is found in Hungary. While very rare, pedestrian signs with similarly condensed stripes can also be found in Czechia.\n- Slovak road signs normally feature a very **bold font**. NOTE: The font on Czech signs is much thinner.\n- Slovak kilometre markers typically have **two sections** divided with a black horizontal line. The top section contains the road number. NOTE: Czech kilometre markers do not have a black horizontal line.\n- Slovak cycling signs use the letter **C** as their symbol, unique to the country. They’re visually analogous to the Czechoslovak hiking markers mentioned in step 1.1, including the yellow post on directional signs.\n- **Window shutters** are considerably more common in Slovakia than in Czechia. NOTE: They are also very common in Hungary.\n- Many Slovak houses have the short side facing the road with the roof ending in a hip end. NOTE: This is also very common in Hungary, but less common in Czechia.\n- **Grey metal roofs** are very common, particularly in the eastern parts of Slovakia. NOTE: Apart from the most mountainous areas, it is far less common in Czechia.\n- While Czechia has a lot of Generation 3 winter coverage, Slovakia has a lot of Generation 3 **spring coverage**.\n- The Slovak railway crossing sign has a white **rectangular background**. NOTE: Czech railway crossing signs do not have a background.\n- It is fairly common to see small signs with **double sign posts** in Slovakia. NOTE: While large signs may have double sign posts, small signs rarely do in Czechia.\n- Slovakia recently changed its standard bollard to a design very similar to the one found in Hungary: a standard European wedge-shaped bollard with a **red front reflector**. Note that for the time being, this bollard is still very rare.\n- It is somewhat more common to see **wooden poles**, and in turn, white concrete supports in Slovakia rather than in Czechia. Note that because there are many variables, it may sometimes be inconsistent. Therefore, this information should preferably be used to help decide between a difficult fifty-fifty."

The most common roof shape is half-hipped roofs.\n- Slovene is a **Slavic language** featuring the special letters Č, Š, and Ž. It is closely related to Croatian, Serbian and Montenegrin. NOTE: On top of having the same letters as Slovene, Croatian also has the letters Ć and Đ.\n- Slovenian bollards are white with a black top. The front reflector will typically be **bright red**, while the back reflector will be **white**.

However, Czech street names will not contain the word “ulica”, which most Slovenian street names have.\n- Slovenian house numbers are typically **red** with white text. NOTE: Czech house numbers are also commonly red.\n- Slovenia uses a regular A-type guardrail, like most European countries. This guardrail type has **rounded edges**. This is mostly useful for 50-50s with Croatia, which uses B-type guardrails. This type has square edges. NOTE: For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- This type of shed, called a kozolec, made of thin **wooden beams** with noticeable gaps in between, is very typical for Slovenia.\n- A black generation 4 car can be found in Slovenia.

See this infographic for more information.\n- On most roads, South Africa utilizes single **yellow outer lines **and white centre lines. NOTE: The other southern African countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia also use single yellow outer lines. !!Australia practically never uses yellow outer lines.\n- South Africa occasionally features unique white **triple centre lines** with 2 solid lines on the outside and a dashed line on the inside. You may also sometimes encounter another unique triple centre line, consisting of two white lines with one yellow line in the middle. These centre lines are usually found on larger main roads. NOTE: The only other countries where you will find road lines like these are the other southern African countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia.\n- **Generation 2 coverage** is quite common in the country. It can be recognized by the large circular car blur and the halo-like colour distortion in the sky. NOTE: On the continent of Africa, Generation 2 is only found in South Africa.\n- South Africa has **11 official languages**: English, Afrikaans, and various Bantu languages. English is the lingua franca and therefore appears most often on signage. **Afrikaans** is a Germanic language that is closely related to Dutch. Common Afrikaans place name suffixes are -fontein, -kraal, -kop, -dorp, -nek, and -berg or -burg. While Afrikaans is most commonly spoken in the western half of the country, you will find Afrikaans place names all over South Africa, meaning that it is not useful for region-guessing. NOTE: Afrikaans is rare to non-existent in Eswatini and Lesotho. It is also abundantly rare in Botswana, but has some limited presence in the form of place names.\n- The most common type of pole in South Africa features 1 to 5 horizontal bars with thin white insulators that resemble rows of birds, which is why they are referred to as “**bird poles**” in the community. NOTE: South Africa has a wide variety of other poles and pole tops. Some of these are (mostly) limited to a certain region; you can learn more about them in the region guessing section.\n- South Africa uses **green** directional signs with the road number in yellow. NOTE: Green directional signs with yellow road numbers are also used in Lesotho, Eswatini, Botswana and Namibia. Here, the format of road numbers is useful: - !!N and R-roads are exclusive to South Africa. - !!A and B-roads are exclusive to Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia. In addition to this, Namibia uses C, D, M and F roads. - !!MR-roads are exclusive to Eswatini.\n- South Africa utilizes **triangular warning signs** with a red border and a white background. NOTE: The four other southern African countries use similar warning signs. !!Australia and New Zealand use yellow diamond-shaped warning signs.\n- South Africa uses **white-and-red **chevrons. You can find a similar chevron pattern below directional signs. In addition, unique-looking small, thin chevrons with one arrow are common next to roads. NOTE: The thin chevrons can also be found in the other southern African countries of Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho and Namibia.\n- Suburban houses in and around large cities will often be surrounded by **high walls,** fences, and gates** **to deter criminals.\n- All Generation 4 coverage in South Africa was taken by a blue Street View car with a short antenna. NOTE: The antenna is sometimes hidden by the blur.\n- South Africa also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, but with a short antenna on the back."

Tall ridges are usually visible to the north or east.\n- The landscape near the Mozambique border in the highlighted area is noticeably **flat**, with green subtropical vegetation.\n- A **camouflage **car with black side mirrors and roof racks can be seen in Kruger National Park, on the Mozambique border. NOTE: The Park now also has generation 4 coverage.\n- The landscape around Kruger National Park is generally flat, with a **savannah **climate and dry vegetation. You will not see any agriculture and the vegetation is mostly made up of grasses, with small trees dotting the landscape. Red soil can also be seen below the grass. In addition, this distinctive directional waystone is commonly found at many junctions.

Italian plates have two blue strips on either side of the plate.\n- The standard Spanish bollards have a **yellow-orange** reflector on the front and two white dots on the back (though the back can also be blank). They are typically hollow. NOTE: Very close to Andorra, you can find a slightly different bollard, which is also used in Andorra itself.\n- In Spain, you can find a variety of electricity poles and pole tops. In small towns and sparsely populated rural areas **concrete ladder poles** and **wooden poles** are the most common. “Ladder” poles have indents that resemble a ladder, hence the name.\n- “**French style**” poletops are common in Spain. They are shaped like an upside down triangle, with a horizontal top bar that is curved slightly upwards. They are usually found on top of tall ladder poles or medium sized steel poles. NOTE: As the name suggests, French poletops are also very common in France.\n- High voltage electricity lines supported by **pylons** are very common in Spain, especially compared to other Mediterranean countries.\n- Spain has distinct road markers with a variety of **colourful borders**. The code on top is the number of the road. NOTE: Andorra has similar markers and the letter codes preceding the road number on these markers are often an important region-specific clue. You can learn more about these codes in the region guessing section.\n- In rural areas you will often find hunting signs. There are two versions, both of which are unique to Spain. One is a simple white sign with a text starting with “coto” and ending in “caza”. The other one has a diagonally divided black and white background. NOTE: These signs have an identifying code that can sometimes be read. In this case “Ex” stands for Extremadura.\n- Spain has **yellow reflectors** on rounded A-type guardrails. NOTE: Belgium, Andorra, Gibraltar and most Latin American countries also have yellow reflectors. For a good overview of European guardrails, see this infographic.\n- Spanish pedestrian crossing signs have **8 stripes**. This is the highest number of stripes in Europe, and almost unique to Spain. NOTE: The only other European country with 8 stripes is Andorra.\n- Spanish stop signs have a distinct **small** font. NOTE: These are mostly useful to distinguish Portugal from Spain: Portuguese stop signs have a noticeably larger font.\n- Red borders on road signs extend all the way to the edge of the sign. There is **no small white border** separating the red part from the edge. NOTE: France, Italy and Portugal have a small white border on the edge of such road signs.\n- Almost all traffic signs, kilometre markers, chevrons and some direction signs in Spain have a **flat signpost**. NOTE: Flat signposts in Europe are also present in Portugal, France and Andorra.\n- Spain has two chevrons: **black with white** arrows, and **blue with white** arrows. Chevrons with a single arrow are rare. NOTE: - In Southern Europe, black with white chevrons can be found in Italy, Greece and Albania. - France is the only other European country that has blue with white chevrons. - Portugal has black with yellow chevrons.\n- Spanish direction signs have a white background. They often feature **colourful boxes** with road numbers, making them recognizable. These road number boxes can be many different colours. Highway signs have a blue background.\n- Rural roads sometimes have **dashed outer lines**. This can help tell Spain apart from Portugal and Italy, where such road lines are (almost) non-existent. Note that the reverse is not true: like Italy and Portugal, many Spanish roads do have solid outer lines.\n- **Spanish** is the main language in most of the country. It is a Romance language that is closely related to Portuguese. Spanish and Portuguese can look very similar. Some key differences between the two: - Ñ is unique to Spanish. - Ç and lh are unique to Portuguese (Ç is also present in Catalan). - Portuguese uses the -ao word ending, and -nh- instead of ñ. - Spanish uses de and del, while these are often contracted to da, do, das and dos in Portuguese. NOTE: Spain also has several regional languages, some of which are more common than Spanish in their respective regions. These languages are discussed in more detail in the region-guessing section.\n- The Spanish word for street is **calle**.\n- You will often find no parking signs in front of garage doors and gates. They will usually read “**Vado permanente**”. These signs will very often have the name of the municipality after “Ayuntamiento de”. NOTE: Italy uses signs that read “Passo carrabile”.\n- Spain has **highly diverse landscapes**, ranging from lush Atlantic forests to bone-dry semideserts. Elevation is also varied: highland plateaus interspersed with rolling hills are common, but you might also encounter jagged mountain ranges and very flat lowland areas.\n- While there is not one single definitive Spanish landscape, most of the country has a somewhat dry, **Mediterranean** climate, with matching vegetation and agriculture.\n- Generation 3 cars can have **long, short** or **no** antennas. The back of the car is usually not visible, but when it is, it can be either black or white. NOTE: Coverage in Eastern Andalusia, Huesca, and Lleida sometimes has a long antenna with a distinctive white top.\n- Generation 4 cars are **blue** or less commonly **black**. The car can be completely hidden.\n- Spain also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot.\n- Google used a weird, low-quality camera in Spain. This camera is known as the **official Ari** (or “Shitcam”). It has a wide circular car blur, and can be distinguished from Generation 2 by its lack of a sky halo and often somewhat brownish colours. A good map will not usually include this coverage, but it is good to be aware of its existence, in order to not be caught off-guard by it."

                "title": "Regional and province-specific clues",
                "description": "- Spanish regional road numbers feature **region-specific codes**. These are found on road markers, and sometimes on direction signs. For example, the SG code on road markers refers to a road in Segovia province. The infographic shows almost all the regional codes, except for some very rare codes. Click on the image to enlarge it. NOTE: - National roads use the following codes: E, AP, A, R, N. These can be found anywhere in the country. - Be careful: A is also used for community roads in Andalusia and Aragon. - Some autonomous communities do not have community roads, only provincial roads. These have been indicated with grey on the map. - Asturias uniquely has a large variety of local road codes. - Ceuta only has N-roads. Melilla uses the code ML.\n- **Area codes** in Spain are very useful, as you only need two digits to get a very accurate guess. Every landline number starts with “9”, followed by the regional numbers. Mobile numbers start with “6”, and are not relevant in region guessing.\n- Spain has several regional languages. The ones that are most useful to GeoGuessr are **Catalan**, **Basque** and **Galician**. Some other regions, such as Asturias, also have their own regional languages. But there, non-Spanish signage is much more rare.\n- **Catalan** is a Romance language that is closely related to both Spanish and French. It is spoken in Catalonia, the Valencian Community, and the Balearic Islands. In Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, it is (much) more common than Spanish on signage. The Valencian Community is more bilingual. If you are unfamiliar with Romance languages, it can be hard to distinguish between Catalan and Spanish. - The Catalan word for “and” is **i**, compared to Spanish y. - The grave accent (**à, è, ò**), is exclusive to Catalan within Spain and very common to see in words, especially on à. - The c with cedilla (**ç**) is also exclusive to Catalan within Spain.\n- The Catalan word for street is “**carrer**”.\n- No parking signs in Catalan speaking areas will read “**Gual permanent**”. Most municipalities use “gual” in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands, while it’s more common to find a mix of Spanish and Catalan signs in Valencia.\n- **Basque** is a language isolate that is spoken in the Basque Country and northern Navarre. In these regions, you will find a mix of Spanish and Basque signs (often bilingual). Basque is not related to any other language, so it has a unique look. Z and K are common letters. NOTE: Basque is also used in the border area of southwest France.\n- Streets in Basque-speaking areas are sometimes called “**kalea**”. However, Spanish “calle” is also still common.\n- Road signs in the Basque Country and Navarre often have these distinctive **bilingual sub-signs** with a **thick black border**. Generally you will find Basque on top in the Basque Country, while it is more common to find Spanish on top in Navarre.\n- **Galician** is a Romance language that is closely related to Portuguese. It is (unsurprisingly) spoken in Galicia. Compared to Catalan, it is less dominant, meaning you will still find a lot of Spanish-only signs in this region. Galician can look very similar to Portuguese. Some ways to tell them apart is the use of **ñ** and the lack of **ç** in Galician.\n- Streets are commonly called **Rúa** in Galicia, whereas in Portugal they are called Rua (without an accent). However, you can sometimes find signs without the accent in Galicia.\n- Many **Galician town names** start with A, O, As or Os articles (examples: “A Pena”, “O Burgo”, “As Cruces”). This is both very common and unique to this region, and rarely over the border in western Asturias.\n- The regional flags of the autonomous communities are reasonably common, so it is worth learning them. NOTE: You can practise them with this quiz.\n- The Catalan Independence flag is not official, but is commonly found in Catalan-speaking areas. It uses the **red-and-yellow** striped Senyera pattern that is also used in four of the autonomous community flags.\n- Spain is a very **mountainous** country. The highest mountain ranges are the Pyrenees in the northeast, and the Baetic System (which includes Sierra Nevada) in the southeast. The Meseta Central is a high altitude, mostly flat area in the centre of the country. It is surrounded by several smaller mountain ranges: the Cantabrian Range in the north, the Iberian System in the east, and Sierra Morena in the south. Within the Meseta Central there are two more mountain ranges: the Sistema Central (going from the Portuguese border to the northeast of Madrid) and Montes de Toledo. There are four big river basins in Spain. The Tajo and Guadiana cross Extremadura and go into Portugal, the Guadalquivir covers most of the southwest of Andalusia and the Ebro river basin starts in Navarra and flows into the mediterranean in the south of Catalonia.\n- The landscape in the far north is much more **green and lush** than the rest of Spain. The landscape is generally quite hilly. Hedges and green meadows are common. In some places, this region’s landscape bears a vague resemblance to Ireland, France and the UK.\n- The **Pyrenees** is a large mountain range on the border between Spain and France. Its mountains are some of the highest in all of Spain. It can be recognized by its light grey rock and abundance of pine trees. Local architecture features many rock walls. NOTE: Andorra and the French part of the Pyrenees look very similar in terms of landscape and architecture. Also consider that the exclave of Llívia is part of Spain.\n- Thick forests of **tall pines** can be found all throughout the Pyrenees. When encountered in smaller mountains in between grazing fields or agricultural land, it will most likely be in the Basque Country or Navarra.\n- The centre of Castilla y León features a **mostly flat agricultural landscape**, with only slight changes in elevation. Most of the fields will have cereal crops like wheat and barley, and it is fairly common to find sunflower plantations.\n- Vineyards can be found in several places in Spain. However, if you see vineyards **in between mountain ranges** to the north and south, you are most likely in La Rioja.\n- Starting in Navarra and cutting across the middle of Aragón, there is a strip of semi-desert landscape on both sides of the Ebro river basin. Light sandy soil and **small shrubs** growing on **small hills** are common in this area.\n- Very **arid** looking and mostly **flat** areas are common in central and south Aragón. The soil is very white and rocky in the northern part. Red soil is more common in Teruel.\n- Castilla la Mancha can have **completely flat landscapes**, which are not that common in Castilla y León. Half of Spain’s wine is produced in this region, so vineyards are fairly common. In the western provinces of Ciudad Real and Toledo, it is very common to see olive tree plantations, generally in flatter ground than those found in Andalusia.\n- Open fields sparsely populated with **holm oaks** (Quercus ilex) and **cork oaks** (Quercus suber) are very common in Extremadura and neighbouring regions. These species of oaks tend to be on the smaller side, and have a Mediterranean look. Be careful not to confuse them with olive trees, as they can look superficially similar to the untrained eye. North of Cáceres the vegetation is more lush and winter and spring coverage is more common.\n- In the southeast of Spain, especially in Murcia, you can find a rather **arid landscape**, with very sandy soil and **medium sized mountains** surrounding. Small shrubs and small plantations of fruit trees and olive trees are a common sight around rural roads.\n- Mountains in this area, especially Murcia and the south of Alicante have a very distinct look. They are quite **rugged**, usually lacking in vegetation. This region commonly features a **hazy** look, making mountains in the distance look like they are behind a sort of mist.\n- The mountain range of Sierra Nevada features **snowy peaks** through the months of November and May. Sierra Nevada is the only mountain range in south Spain with snow during most of the year.\n- Towns built **on a mountain face**, consisting entirely of white houses, are very common on the south coast of Spain, around Málaga.\n- **Olive trees** are one of the main crops planted in Spain, they can be commonly seen in more than half of the country.\n- Around Córdoba and Jaén, you can find massive **olive tree plantations** growing over **rolling hills** and going as far as the eye can see. The bigger and more remote plantations are usually only covered in Generation 2.\n- South of Madrid, olive tree plantations are usually in small or medium sized fields, in mostly flat terrain and commonly accompanied by red soil.\n- Olive plantations on the east coast are commonly fenced or behind rock walls and you will almost always see mountains in some direction.\n- All throughout the north coast of Spain you will find **eucalyptus plantations** looking like this. Galicia has more plantations than the rest of the north combined. NOTE: Eucalyptus plantations are also extremely common in Portugal.\n- When you encounter **eucalyptus trees in a dry environment**, you will most likely be in the province of Huelva. You can find them more rarely in Extremadura in the north and up until Córdoba in the east.\n- On the east coast of Spain, you can find many **orange tree plantations**. They are usually in small valleys, and if they are in flat land you can usually see mountains to the west, north or south.\n- In the Guadalquivir river basin you can also find many orange plantations, usually in much more open and flat terrain than those of the east coast. There are some extensive plantations in the mountains, but coverage is sparse there.\n- **Corn** is most commonly grown in big river basins in Spain. It is also grown on the north coast, especially Galicia, and in an area in the north west of Castilla y León.\n- **Stone pines** (Pinus pinea) can be recognized by their fluffy leaves, and compact bulbous crown that is wider than it is tall. Forests of exclusively stone pines in a flat area are very common around Valladolid and Huelva. It is common to see them in the mountains close to Barcelona in residential areas.\n- **Aleppo pines** (Pinus halepensis) also have fluffy leaves, but their crown is less compact, more disorganised looking, and often taller, compared to stone pines. This is the most common pine on the east coast of Spain and the Balearic Islands.\n- **Baltic pines** (Pinus sylvestris) are tall and thin, with a dark bark that sheds at the top, revealing the orange-red wood underneath. They usually do not have branches on the bottom half of the trunk, especially when fully grown. Baltic pines can be found in mainly three mountain ranges: the Pyrinees, Sierra de Guadarrama and the Iberian System.\n- **Maritime pines** (Pinus Pinaster) has two variants in Spain, near the Atlantic coast, it has grey bark with red undertones, and fluffy branches that point upwards. Older trees often don’t have any branches in the bottom half of the tree. NOTE: Plantations of this pine are extremely common in north and central Portugal.\n- In the rest of Spain you can find the Mediterranean variant of the tree. It still has a grey bark with red tones, and it is usually very fissured. You can find the tree in most of the mountain ranges in central and southern Spain. Extensive plantations in flat ground can be found North of Segovia.\n- On small roads, particularly those without a middle line, roadlines can be a very good clue to determine where in the country a location can be. - In places where straight outer lines are prevalent you will very rarely find dashed outer lines. - In places where dashed outer lines are the main style, finding straight outer lines is rare, but less so than for the reverse. Some provinces have their own style of roadline, such as Araba where simple long dashed middle lines are the most common style, or Gipuzkoa, where you can see long outside dashes in roads with a middle line. Catalonia also frequently features atypical roadlines but there is not one prevalent design.\n- Most kilometre markers in Spain are either rectangular or square in shape. This can be a good clue to exclude half the country if you can see one in the distance. There are also some unique designs. - Andalusian markers are especially tall, featuring an extra stripe with the name of the governing body responsible for the road. - Madrid markers are square and feature the regional flag at the top. - Markers in Biscay are bigger than usual and feature a semi-circle shape at the top. NOTE: National roads will always have a red rectangular marker.\n- Kilometre markers in Spain feature a coloured border. The standard colours, going from bigger to smaller roads, are **orange**, **green**, and **yellow**. Some autonomous communities and provinces use different colours, or even unique designs altogether. You can read more about the unique designs in this document.\n- Galician towns frequently use signs with a **green or blue strip** at the top featuring the name of the municipality. NOTE: “Concello” is the Galician word for municipality, and exclusive to the region.\n- Most bus stops in Asturias have a red post with the CTA logo at the top. NOTE: These may be confused with Madrid bus stops, which can also have a red post. The company in charge of Madrid public transport goes by EMT.\n- Trash containers in Asturias frequently have the logo of COGERSA, the logo’s shape is distinct and can be recognized from afar. NOTE: Recycling bins can also feature this logo.\n- Yellow snow poles with one or two reflectors are unique to Asturias. They are usually found in the south of the region.\n- In Aragón, it is common to see this bollard design on regional roads. It has a simple design, consisting of a short flat rectangular white stick with a grey reflector on both sides. NOTE: There are similar bollards in other regions, but they appear much less frequently than in Aragón.\n- Many signs in Catalonia have **round, corrugated signposts**. This is especially common for direction signs. A similar design is also common in the Basque Country and the Balearic Islands. Note that municipalities may use signposts like this anywhere in the country, and that regular traffic signs retain the standard flat Spanish design. NOTE: French signs have a very similar design.\n- In Catalonia and sometimes the Balearic Islands you will find huntings signs in Catalan, usually reading “**Àrea privada de Caça**”.\n- Within mainland Spain, this bollard is almost exclusive to the provinces of Lleida and Tarragona in Catalonia. It features a more **square and orange reflector** on the front, compared to the standard Spanish bollard design. There is a **white reflector** on the back, instead of the two dots of standard bollards. Some toll highways like the AP-6 also use this design. NOTE: This bollard can also be found on the eastern half of the Canary Islands.\n- Big square chevrons with a **single arrow** are commonly found in Catalonia.\n- Small square chevrons with a **red arrow** on a white background are exclusive to Murcia.\n- The surrounding region of Madrid has round topped **red bus stops**, and **green buses**. Some bus stops are just a red post. In the city centre, you can find urban blue buses.\n- In the region of Extremadura, it is common to see the normal Spanish bollards with **green tops**. This bollard variant is exclusive to this region.\n- In Castilla la Mancha you can find stone markers with the region’s coat of arms lining up fields. It can be recognized from afar by the blue coloured left side and the unpainted right side.\n- Poles with a **steel mesh** structure making **rectangular shapes** instead of the typical triangles can be found in the southern half of Spain, and are particularly common in Murcia and southern Alicante.\n- Signs from the local government of Andalusia are very recognizable because of the **green stripe** on the left side. It is also very common to see small versions of these signs around nature reserves with **green signposts**.\n- **Blue and yellow snow poles** are unique to Andalusia.\n- There is a large part of north-west Spain where you will find almost exclusively **slate roofs** (recognisable by their almost black colour). This type of roofing can be seen sparingly all the way to the west coast of Galicia, but ends rather abruptly on the east. Slate roofs can also be found in the Pyrenees near Andorra, and in the mountain ranges north east of Madrid.\n- Many houses in Galicia are built with **big concrete blocks**, sometimes textured to resemble natural stone. Plain concrete blocks are also an extremely common material for walls and miscellaneous buildings like garages.\n- In Galicia, these unique **granaries** called “horreos gallegos”, or “cabazos”, are very common. Note that they can be made from various materials, but the shape remains the same.\n- In Asturias, “hórreos” are bigger, generally with a square design, and are built above four pillars, with or without walls. You will sometimes find a **rectangular** variation, usually built on top of six or eight pillars called “panera”. If you find an “horreo” with a slate roof, you will be in western Asturias.\n- **Large white houses** with wooden frames are common in the Basque Country, the Basque part of Navarra, and Cantabria.\n- Traditional farm houses called “masías” are common in Catalonia, eastern Aragón and parts of the Valencian Community. They are usually made of stone and stand isolated or as part of a small complex.\n- Within the centre and south of Spain, towns made **completely** out of **white painted houses** are very common in Andalucía and Extremadura. You can still see a fair amount of white painted houses in Castilla la Mancha but streets where every house is white will not be common.\n- In Asturias you can find a **black** car with **no antenna** and a visible brake light. NOTE: This car can very rarely spill into neighbour regions like Galicia.\n- You can sometimes find a special Generation 3 antenna with a distinctive **white top**, similar to the one found in Gibraltar. This antenna is found in the eastern half of Andalusia and in the provinces of Huesca and Lleida in the northeast of the country.\n- The **Balearic islands** have a recognizable, coastal Mediterranean look. Somewhat dry looking forests of Aleppo pines cover most of the hills, and small patches of agricultural land, mainly with fruit trees and olive trees, cover the flatter areas between towns.\n- Low **rock walls** are extremely common on the Balearic Islands. NOTE: Another Mediterranean region with a similar amount of rock walls is the area around Bari in Italy. This region can sometimes look similar to the Balearic Islands.\n- The stereotypical Balearic house is painted completely **white**. You can find flat roofs, but tiled roofs with a small incline are the most common.\n- Within the Balearic Islands, **grazing fields** are almost exclusive to the island of Menorca.\n- The small island of Formentera frequently features low **coastal shrubs**. It is common to be able to see the mountains of Ibiza from Formentera’s north coast.\n- The north-west of Palma has a **tall mountain range** that can be seen from many places on the island. It is the only island in the Balearics with mountains this big.\n- The **Canary Islands** (or Canaries for short) are a Spanish archipelago off the west coast of Africa. Because they are so far away from mainland Spain, being able to consistently recognize them is important for your scores. NOTE: Do not confuse their location with the nearby Portuguese island groups of the Azores and Madeira.\n- The Canaries have **extremely diverse landscapes**, including steep mountains, pine forests, volcanic soil, and extreme aridity. You can also encounter more normal landscapes that can look more like mainland Spain. NOTE: Because of its diversity, it is hard to pin down the average landscape in the Canaries. A more useful strategy is to focus on whether it looks unique and unlike anything that you would find in mainland Europe: if meta matches with Spain, but something is “off” in terms of vibe, consider the Canaries.\n- In some parts of the island of **Lanzarote** on the Canary Islands, a very dark, exposed volcanic soil can be seen. In places, this landscape superficially resembles the surface of the moon. NOTE: The other Canary Islands can sometimes have similar landscapes as well, but it is by far the most common on Lanzarote.\n- The island of **Fuerteventura** in the Canary Islands is characterised by a very arid landscape with little to no vegetation. Orange soil is very common, and within the Canary Islands archipelago essentially unique to this island.\n- This **unique bollard design** is extremely common in the province of Las Palmas (which includes the islands of Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote). It features a more square and orange reflector on the front, compared to the standard Spanish bollard design. There is a white reflector on the back, instead of the two dots of standard bollards. This bollard can also be found on mainland Spain, in the provinces of Lleida and Tarragona. NOTE: The province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (which includes the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, El Hierro and La Palma) only uses bollards on highways, with the standard Spanish design.\n- You can find these **unique wine plantations** with volcanic soil and rocks in the shape of a semicircle on the island of Lanzarote.\n- Off the north coast of Lanzarote, you will find the small island of **La Graciosa**. The island’s landscape is completely barren, and the entire coverage features **overcast weather**. There are two towns on the south coast of the island, with white flat-roofed houses like the east Canaries.\n- The two Spanish enclaves of **Ceuta **and** Melilla** in North Africa, which are partially surrounded by Morocco, both have coverage. They often catch beginning players off-guard, so it is good to be aware of them and their location.\n- Ceuta features north African architecture, consisting of mainly flat roofed houses in warm colours, ranging from pale yellow to red. Almost all of the Generation 4 coverage in Ceuta features a **bright blue sky** in sunny weather with occasional clouds.\n- You will find a **mountainous, mediterranean** landscape in Ceuta, featuring a mix of eucalyptus trees and pines.\n- Within Spain, **black and white guardrails** are unique to Ceuta.\n- Melilla also features similar North African architecture. The coverage in Melilla has a **hazy** look, with a significantly less saturated sky than Ceuta. Most of the coverage is cloudy or overcast. Melilla has little rural coverage, mainly by the Morocco-Spain border."

                "description": "- The **Camino de Santiago** (the **Way of St. James** in English), is a network of pilgrim's ways across Europe leading to the shrine of apostle James (Santiago in Spanish) in Santiago de Compostela. These paths are frequently marked with a yellow scallop on a blue background. Markers can be found both in traffic signs and in waystones. It is common to see pilgrims hiking or biking along these routes, particularly during the summer. NOTE: Markers for it can be found all over Europe, going as far as Lithuania, but are much more common the closer you are to Santiago.\n- Coverage during early spring on dirt roads between green grassy fields, and leafless vineyards with red soil, is very common in the central-north part of Castilla la Mancha. This type of coverage is particularly extensive in the northern part and exclusively in generation 3. Towards the south you will also find very similar looking coverage in generation 4.\n- The AP-15 in Navarra features unique bollards with a simple flat design and a square red reflector. Guardrails also have red reflectors unlike the rest of Spain.\n- Taxis in Barcelona are black with yellow doors, including the trunk door.\n- The Ebro delta (Deltebre in catalan) features an extremely **flat **landscape, where **rice fields** and **water canals** are very common. There are significant mountains to the South, West, and North, and some of them can be seen from almost every location in the delta.\n- Between Almeria and Motril you can find many **greenhouses** with white roofs, in the lowland area close to the sea. They are especially common in El Ejido.\n- The city of Bilbao uses this unique street sign, with a very **elaborately decorated frame**. It is not found anywhere else in Spain.\n- In Doñana National Park, southwest of Seville, you will find this rare and unique car meta."

                "title": "Identifying Sri Lanka",
                "description": "- Vehicles in Sri Lanka have **long white front** plates and **short yellow rear** plates.\n- In most Generation 3 coverage, you will be able to see the **front of the Google car** partially through the blur: it is visible as blue-white-red patches, reminiscent of the French flag. The red patch is usually most visually distinct. NOTE: This car is unique to Sri Lanka. Coverage in Ghana has a similar front of the car visible, but this coverage also has a roof rack.\n- All Generation 4 coverage is **low-cam**. This means that the camera on the Google car is intentionally set up lower than in most other countries. This can be recognized in two ways: - The car blur is significantly bigger. Generally, the bigger car blur is the most consistent way to recognize low-cam. - Roads look wider and objects around you are seen from a lower angle. Note that Sri Lanka’s Generation 3 coverage is made with a normal height camera! NOTE: All coverage in Japan and Switzerland is low-cam. However, landscape should be sufficient to tell these apart from Sri Lanka.\n- In Sri Lanka, you will see two scripts: **Sinhala** and **Tamil**. You will also sometimes see English, written in Latin script. Sinhala is most common, and can be found throughout the entire country. It has a very curvy, ‘rounded’ look. Tamil is more regionally limited. It has straighter lines. For an exact distribution, see the region-guessing section. NOTE: Sinhala is unique to Sri Lanka. However, Tamil can also be found in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\n- Sri Lanka typically uses **concrete utility poles**. Two pole types are common and distinctive: - Square poles with small pinholes in the sides. These pinholes are limited to the top part of the pole. - Poles with large see-through holes in the lower half of the pole (“holey poles“). These poles are unique to Sri Lanka. NOTE: The square poles with small pinholes can look very similar to those found in Thailand. However, in Thailand the pinholes extend all the way to the bottom of the pole.\n- These short, wide **stone bollards** are unique to Sri Lanka. They have a tapered shape, with a black base and a white top.\n- Tall, white concrete waystones with an indented section near the bottom containing a yellow road number, are unique to Sri Lanka.\n- Sri Lanka commonly uses **black and white** striped signposts. NOTE: Within South and Southeast Asia, such signposts are also found in Bangladesh, India and Malaysia.\n- Rural roads often have **outside lines, but no middle lines**. In the absence of other clues, this can sometimes be a way to decide a tough 50-50. NOTE: Most small roads lack road lines entirely.\n- Sri Lanka is a **tropical** country. It usually has very lush, green vegetation. It is densely populated and many parts are covered in a patchwork of agricultural fields.\n- Many parts of Sri Lanka have **reddish soil**. Less commonly, you may encounter white, sandy soil.\n- **Palm trees** are very common in Sri Lanka, more so than many other Asian countries. NOTE: Palm trees are also very common in the Philippines.\n- Houses often have **orange or red tiled roofs**. Due to wear and tear, these tiles often have an almost brown tint to them. NOTE: Similar roofs are also common in parts of Indonesia.\n- The country is majority **Buddhist**: 70% of the population practise this religion. Throughout the country, you will often see signs of the religion, including temples, Buddha statues, stupas and the Buddhist flag. NOTE: Thailand, Cambodia and Laos are also majority Buddhist.\n- A substantial minority of the population adhere to **other religions**: Hinduism (13%), Islam (10%) and Christianity (7%). These religions have strong regional distribution patterns; see the region-guessing section for more information.\n- This style of **tuktuk** is common in Sri Lanka: it has a bulky shape and a black roof. They are usually coloured green, yellow or red, though other colours appear as well.\n- Google used a weird, low-quality camera in Sri Lanka. This camera is known as the official Ari (or “Shitcam”). It has a wide circular car blur and often somewhat brownish colours. A good map will not usually include this coverage, but it is good to be aware of its existence, in order to not be caught off-guard by it. NOTE: Other tropical countries with shitcam include India, Cambodia, Ecuador and to a lesser extent Bangladesh."

The first digit of that area code is always a 0, while the remaining two digits are shown on the map. Mobile phone numbers always start with 07 and are not associated with any particular region. _You can click on the image to enlarge it. Image credit: Maccem._\n- These maps shows the distribution of each of Sri Lanka’s **four main religions**. This can help with region-guessing when you spot a house of worship or other symbol associated with one of the religions. - Buddhism is found in most of the country but is mostly absent from the north and some parts of the east coast. - Hinduism is predominantly found in the north and parts of the east, as well as around the town of Nuwara Eliya in the central mountains. - Islam is strongest on the east coast, but not a majority in any district. - Christianity is mostly confined to the northwest, and is strongest around the town of Mannar. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- The presence of the **Tamil script** is strongly correlated with the distribution of Hinduism (though not all Tamils are Hindu and vice versa). There are two groups that use the Tamil script: - Native Sri Lankan Tamils, who predominantly live in the north and the east. - Indian Tamils, who mostly live in and around the central Nuwara Eliya district. Note that it is not uncommon to find bilingual Sinhala and Tamil signs far outside the area where Tamil is the predominant language. However, Tamil-only signage can be a strong indicator for one of the Tamil-majority areas. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- This map shows Sri Lanka’s **topography**. Hills and mountains are strongly concentrated in the central-southern part of the country. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- The southwest of Sri Lanka has a more **wet climate** that is characterised by lush, dense vegetation. Deep green tones dominate the landscape.\n- Conversely, the rest of the country has a slightly more **dry climate**. The vegetation is often lower and more open. The landscape usually has a mix of brown and green tones. Note that the difference is not extreme, as the landscape in Sri Lanka never truly gets downright arid. However, with some practise, you can often learn to tell the difference. Your mileage may also vary depending on the season, local forest cover, or coverage type (Generation 3 often tends to make the landscape look more arid than it really is).\n- **Tea plantations** are found in the central and southwestern parts of the country. They are most common in the area just west of Nuwara Eliya. Tea plants look like small, compact shrubs with bright green leaves. They are usually planted in organised rows or clusters on hillsides."

                "description": "- Swedish **licence plates** are long, white, and have the standard blue EU strip on the left side. Licence plates on taxis have a yellow background instead of white.\n- **Swedish** is a North Germanic language that is closely related to Danish and Norwegian. The Swedish alphabet contains the special letters **Å**, **Ä** and **Ö**. NOTE: The special letters found in Swedish can also be found in some of the other Northern Germanic languages: - Danish uses Å, but not** **Ä or Ö. - Norwegian uses Å, but not** **Ä or Ö. - Icelandic uses Ö, but not Å or Ä. Finnish uses Ä and Ö. Å is also used, but is treated as Swedish. Finnish words are typically longer and often use double vowels, which are very rare in Swedish.\n- On smaller roads, the outer road lines are white and dashed. They are distinctly shorter than the Norwegian dashed lines. In contrast to Norway and Finland, **all** road lines are **white**.\n- The outer road lines on highways look solid from a distance, but are typically divided into **small sections** with a unique pattern, which is different from the solid lines in Finland and Norway. Road lines in Denmark can have a similar pattern, however the individual sections should be rectangular.\n- Swedish bollards are **black-and-white**, typically with a grey reflector. Reflectors by intersections are commonly orange instead. They can be either wedge-shaped, round, or thin and curved.\n- Snow poles are typically **orange,** with a tall white reflector slightly above the middle of the pole. Some poles have a second, thinner reflector above the normal one. NOTE: Finland and Norway both have similar orange snow poles. The reflector on Finnish poles is usually much thinner and very close to the top. Norwegian poles typically have either one or two slightly thinner reflectors, with one commonly being very close to the middle.\n- Swedish utility poles are usually **wooden** and can have a variety of poletops. There is commonly a small black metal cap on the very top, which is only found in Nordic countries. NOTE: Norway and Finland also use primarily wooden poles.\n- Lamps attached to wooden poles in Sweden are normally mounted slightly **below the** **top **of the pole with a **double bolting**. NOTE: Within Scandinavia, Finland also uses double bolting. However, Finland’s lamps are mounted at the top and are much straighter.\n- These wooden electricity markers, with a **blue** and a **white stripe** at the top, are often found near utility poles and pylons, and are not found in any other Nordic country.\n- Swedish pedestrian signs have **four stripes**. There is notably a version featuring a female silhouette. NOTE: Finnish and Danish pedestrian signs have five stripes. Norwegian pedestrian signs usually have four stripes, but can also have five.\n- Most **directional signs** are blue with a white font and border. A thin arrow shows the direction. Yellow signs with a black font and red border are also common. Places showcased on yellow signs are typically very small and thus hard to find on a map. NOTE: Norwegian directional signs are yellow or white, and the white arrow on Finnish signs is filled in.\n- Swedish road signs have a **red border** and a **yellow background**. NOTE: Finnish road signs have a thin yellow border outside the red one.\n- Sweden is the only country in Europe whose chevrons have **yellow arrows** on a **blue **background. NOTE: While very rare, yellow on blue chevrons also exist in Luxembourg.\n- On smaller roads, it is common to see these blue signs with a **large white** **M**. NOTE: Similar signs can be found in Norway, however the font is distinctly different. The middle point of the M extends to the bottom of the letter. There are no similar signs in Finland.\n- Signposts will often have **striped markings**. Blue and white, and red and yellow are the two most common, but you can also find other colours such as blue and red or white and red. NOTE: Blue and white markings can be found in several other countries, such as Finland and Estonia, however the other colour schemes are essentially unique to Sweden.\n- On top of having red and yellow road signs and signpost markings, Sweden often has a lot of road infrastructure, such as road work signs and road blocks, painted red and yellow. You can even come across red and yellow chevrons.\n- Swedish **street names** most commonly use the suffixes “vägen” and “gatan”. They are often shortened into “v” and “g” respectively on street signs. Street names can also use “väg” or “gata” as a separate word in a street name. Additionally, the suffix “gränd” can be found near city centres. NOTE: Norway uses veien or vei, gate or gaten, and gata attached to the rest of the street name, rather than as a separate word. Denmark uses vej and gade.\n- Houses in the Swedish countryside are most commonly wooden and often painted with a distinct **dark red** paint, which is almost exclusively found in Sweden, Norway and Finland. Urban architecture is usually modern and made of concrete and bricks, while suburban buildings are commonly freestanding single family houses built of either wood or brick.\n- Sweden has a varied landscape, with a lot of **boreal forests**, small to medium-sized farmlands and many lakes. The northern and western parts of the country are quite mountainous, with long, narrow lakes and rivers, while the southern and eastern parts are generally flatter.\n- This type of traditional wooden fence, made out of thin spaced out vertical tree trunks and slightly diagonal trunks stacked on top of each other, is commonly found in Sweden. NOTE: Similar fences can be found in other Nordic countries, particularly in Norway near the Swedish border, but are significantly less common.\n- The most common car brand in Sweden is **Volvo**, which makes up almost 30% of all passenger cars. NOTE: Approximately 10% of all passenger cars in both Norway and Finland are Volvo.\n- The **Swedish church flag** has a red cross on a yellow background with a crown in the middle, and is often found near churches throughout the country.\n- A **white** street view car with a **long antenna** is featured on a lot of Generation 3 coverage. NOTE: A similar car is found on all road coverage in Iceland and is also somewhat common in Finland. While it exists in both Norway and Denmark, it is extremely rare in both.\n- Generation 4 coverage in Sweden features three Street View cars: a red, a white, and a blue car. Each of the cars can be seen with or without a visible antenna. NOTE: Only the blue car is found in Norway, Finland and Denmark.\n- Sweden has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. NOTE: Most of Northern Europe also has smallcam."

                "description": "- **Broad leafed trees**, other than birches, only grow naturally in the southern half of the country, and become increasingly common the further south you get.\n- **Ferns** are mostly found in southern and central Sweden. It can occasionally be found further north in the east.\n- While it is possible to see forested mountains in several regions in the country, mountains with **no trees at the top** can only be found in the northwestern parts of the country.\n- This type of vegetation, consisting of thin, **weak-looking boreal trees** and somewhat sandy soil can be found in the far north of Sweden.\n- **Beech forests**, which can generally be recognised by the barren ground covered in brown leafs, are mainly found in the far south.\n- **Rock walls** are mainly found in the south, with the largest concentration being in several coastal areas, on Öland, and on the southern and northern tips of Gotland. Beware that rock walls around churches and cemeteries are common further north.\n- It is very common to see exposed, often somewhat round, **rocks **on the Swedish west coast. They will often have lower vegetation, such as small bushes, growing on them. NOTE: Exposed rocks around Stockholm are also fairly common, however these typically look sharper than rocks on the west coast, and commonly have thick moss growing on them.\n- In Skåne you will find the **most open agricultural landscape** in Sweden. It is the only region where, rather than a dense forest in the distance, you can get only a few small patches of trees strewn across the fields. On top of that, crops are often more diverse than the cereal crops, which are typical for the rest of Sweden.\n- The area surrounding lake Mälaren can often be recognized by the fairly **flat** ground with medium sized agricultural fields, forests beyond them, and small “islands” of bushes and trees in the middle of the fields.\n- The agricultural landscape of Västergötland and Östergötland is mostly flat, similarly to the landscape around lake Mälaren. The two most consistent differences is that this landscape is **more open** and has lots of **wind turbines**. While you can almost always see a forest in the distance, it will typically be much further away than around Mälaren.\n- On the west coast, and particularly in Halland, you will see a lot of flat agricultural fields with small, round, **forested hills** in the distance. Generally, the hills get larger and the fields get smaller further north. The area also has more precipitation than most of the country, and as such it typically looks very lush.\n- If you see **flat**, medium-sized to small **agricultural fields**, and you suspect that you are in the northern half of the country, you are likely somewhat close to the coast between Umeå and Luleå.\n- In most of Jämtland County, particularly around lake Storsjön, you can find large farmlands, commonly situated in the middle of wide, often somewhat steep **hills**, which is uncommon in the rest of the country, where most farmlands will be either on flat ground or in valleys. The fields are generally not cultivated and will mostly consist of **ordinary grass**.\n- The landscape around the High Coast in Västernorrland can be recognised by the many **forested, rocky mountains** surrounding agricultural valleys. The valleys are rarely straight and the mountains are of varying heights and shapes.\n- Agricultural fields in and around Södermanland very often go through **small valleys**, with forests up on the sides of the valleys. The fields are typically medium to small sized.\n- **White sand** can often be seen next to roads on Gotland. It is typically more noticeable in the northern half of the island and on Fårö.\n- Traditional Swedish fences are typically made of thin round tree trunks and branches. However, on Gotland these fences are typically made of larger trunks that have been cut into **sharp-looking wedges**.\n- **Red dirt roads **are mainly found in Dalarna, but can also be found in and around Kalmar county, the border between inland Norrbotten and Västerbotten, and rarely between lakes Vänern and Vättern.\n- Dirt roads which have a **deep grey colour** and are aligned with low, **green grassy vegetation** on either side are commonly found in the northern half of Jämtland. This is mostly found in Generation 4 summer and Generation 3 fall coverage.\n- Öland is an **extremely flat** island with a somewhat barren south half with many small bushes, while the north is typically slightly lusher with fewer, but larger bushes and some trees. The island also contains a very large number of small rock walls.\n- It is very common to see long, neat rows of moderately thin** birches **in urban areas along the north coast.\n- **Grey metal roofs** on residential buildings generally get more common the further north in the country you get. Note that metal roofs on barns and sheds can be found significantly further south.\n- Houses in Skåne commonly have either a white stone, or a red brick wall with a **coloured wooden triangle** beneath the roof on the sides. Similar houses with other materials (such as grey brick) for the walls can be found elsewhere in the southern half of the country.\n- **Half-timbered houses** can be found mainly in the southern half of Skåne, but also in the northern half and southern Halland. It can also be found in Visby on rare occasions.\n- A lot of single family houses in Skåne are built out of **red brick**. They typically look slightly older than red brick houses in other parts of the country. NOTE: Red brick architecture is also very common in Denmark.\n- **Corrugated square metal roof panels** with **moss** growing on them are typically found in southern Sweden, particularly in Skåne and Blekinge. It is mainly found on large barns, and the roofs are often very steep.\n- Grey **diamond-tiled roofs** are mainly found in Skåne, Blekinge, Öland, and occasionally on Gotland. NOTE: Gotland and Öland are normally more easily recognised from landscape alone. Houses in western and southern Skåne typically use a lot of stone and bricks, while houses in northeastern Skåne and Blekinge are mostly made of red painted wood.\n- While houses in Sweden are mostly very colourful, on the west coast they are commonly **much lighter**. There are an especially large number of white and light yellow houses along the coast between Gothenburg and the Norwegian border.\n- **Dense rows** of very **small red sheds** are commonly found in coastal towns on the northern west coast.\n- Central Dalarna has a strong tradition of **wooden craftsmanship**, and as a result much of the architecture has a unique, picturesque look to it. Most commonly, you may find red timbered houses, portals made of logs, and so-called härbren which have a very distinct design. NOTE: Similar buildings can be found elsewhere in the country, but it is by far most common in central Dalarna.\n- Hälsingland has many big, mostly red, farmhouses. They are characterised by many large **windows**, 2–3 floors, and the front facade being long and grand-looking. Barns can also be seen having an unusual amount of windows in the region.\n- Along the northern coast you will commonly encounter agricultural sheds which are either **octagonal** or rectangular, with the walls noticeably **leaning outwards**. They will typically be made out of red-painted logs.\n- Houses on Gotland are commonly made of **limestone** and often have a dirty-looking white facade. Churches on Gotland are very distinct looking, with either grey walls or white walls with grey corners, a large portal around the door and small windows typically divided in two by a pillar.\n- This type of uneven **stone brick** is typically found in houses and rock walls on Öland, and less commonly in rock walls on Gotland.\n- Each administrative region in Sweden has at least one, and in many cases several, bus stop signs which are unique to that region. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Many regions have their own distinct type of bus shelters, which may either replace or complement the bus stop signs. This image contains the ones which are most common and easily recognizable. NOTE: Every region has multiple types of bus shelters, these are simply the most common. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Besides the European highways, there are two types of numbered roads in Sweden, **national roads** (9-99) and **regional roads** (100-404). Numbers typically increase the further northeast you get. These maps are only approximate, since some roads go across many of the regions shown. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Small **red crosses** marking snowmobile trails can be found throughout the northern half of the country.\n- Many roads in western Dalarna and nearby regions have a very noticeable **red colour**. NOTE: Forests in the region predominantly consist of thin pines, which, in combination with the red roads, is a very good indication of the region.\n- **Green snow poles** can occasionally be found in the area surrounding Umeå.\n- **Wedge-shaped bollards**, similar to those found in Germany, are most common in the southern regions of the country.\n- **Cylindrical bollards**, with a completely **horizontal black section** near the top, are most commonly found near the west coast and in Värmland and southern Dalarna.\n- **Flat bollards**, or cylindrical bollards with a **black rectangle** containing the reflector are most commonly found on major roads in the northern half of the country. Beware that one type of flat bollards can look similar to the cylindrical bollards from the last tip, however the black section here is not horizontal.\n- These small white bollards with either a blue or a red strip near the top can be found in the countryside of Skåne. NOTE: You may occasionally find similar bollards in urban areas further north.\n- The backside of railway crossing signs have a yellow sticker with a 5-digit ID number. The **first digit** indicates the region, and it predominantly increases to the northeast. NOTE: The first digit may also be a 6, which can be found randomly throughout most of the country.\n- Some **place name endings** are limited to a certain region. This map shows some common and useful endings. Place names are not limited to just villages and towns: local farmsteads and other geographical points of interest are also included. The distributions shown on the maps are not 100% definite. Some exceptions exist. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Sámi bilingual signs** can be found inland in the northern parts of Sweden.\n- **Meänkieli** is a language closely related to Finnish, which is found close to the Finnish border. One of the most common occurrences on signage is for river names, which will end in “**väylä**”. It is also possible to find trilingual signs with both Meänkieli and Sámi. NOTE: As a general principle, if you encounter Finnish sounding place names, you are also likely to be fairly close to the Finnish border.\n- Along the Swedish west coast, and in Skåne, you may find a white Google car with a **blue stripe** on the back. NOTE: This car is almost never found outside of Sweden.\n- The first 3-4 (2 in Stockholm) digits of landline phone numbers in Sweden are the **area code**. The map shows the first two digits in every region. Within the regions, the third and fourth digit of area codes typically increase to the northeast. NOTE: Mobile phone numbers always begin with 07. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._"

                "description": "- The E10 between Kiruna and the Norwegian border is a major road which can be recognised by the vegetation mainly consisting of **small birches**, occasionally with some pines strewn in, combined with snow covered mountains, which can typically be seen in the distant west close to Kiruna, and in all directions when you approach the border. A major lake can also be seen to the north on the western half of the road.\n- The northern section of road 99 can usually be recognized by its grey **sandy ground** with brown-green moss, the noticeable ditch following most of the road and its fairly low, dense forest with a mixture of birches, pines and spruces. Beware that the most recent coverage on much of the road was taken during early spring, which makes some of these features harder to recognise.\n- The road to Ritsem can generally be recognised by having a large lake following it on the south, combined with having some of the most **dramatic mountains** seen on Street View in the country. The road is small and **without roadlines**, but still fairly well-paved. It is covered both in summer and in early spring.\n- Most mountain roads in Sweden have been built below the treeline, resulting in small trees being visible on almost all coverage. The only paved road in Sweden above the treeline, with **no visible trees**, can be found on the border between Jämtland and Västerbotten, near the Norwegian border. The coverage was taken during fall, giving the limited vegetation a yellowish brown colour.\n- The highest altitude public road in Sweden, which is a dirt road going straight over a **treeless mountain plateau**, was covered in Generation 4 on a cloudy day during summer. NOTE: The highest point on the road features a parking spot and is right on top of the “Falkvålen” label.\n- In Kiruna it is very common to get a glimpse of one of the **two mountains** which have taken shape as a result of the local mine, one to the south and one to the north. On the side of both mountains, different layers in the shape of a staircase may be seen, which is a very strong indication of the town. The mountains may also be spotted from the E10 west of the town.\n- In the town of Gällivare you can often see a mountain with a **smooth slope** and a **low tree line **to the southwest. No other town in Sweden has a natural treeless mountain in such close proximity.\n- If you are surrounded by flat agricultural fields, with a single **forested hill range** to the **west**, you are likely to be east of Omberg in western Östergötland.\n- **Mistletoe** is mainly found near lake Mälaren and is particularly common in the city of Västerås.\n- The island of Visingsö in the middle of Lake Vättern can often be recognised by the agricultural fields with the lake being visible both to the **northwest and southeast**, with forested hills at the shore of either side of the lake.\n- A majority of all large **orchards** in Sweden are found around the town of Kivik on the east coast of Skåne. Large orchards can also be found northeast of Kristianstad in Vånga, around Båstad, and on the southern east coast of lake Vättern.\n- Following the northern west coast of Öland you will find this small coastal road, with a **rocky beach** and low, **bushy vegetation**.\n- If you suspect you are on Gotland, and see small, **dry stony fields** with **small juniper bushes**, you are very likely to be on Fårö. This landscape becomes more extreme near the north coast of the island.\n- On the southern tip of Gotland you can find this west coastal road with grassy fields and a **grassy hill ridge** to the east.\n- Near the coast north and east of Uppsala, you can come across old factory towns called Walloon mills. They typically consist of long rows of identical residential houses, which can either be made of brightly coloured stone or red wood, as well as small belfries, mansions and factory buildings, which are typically made in similar styles as the residential buildings.\n- Buildings made fully or partially out of **blue or green slag stone** can occasionally be found in the mining region of Bergslagen.\n- Numerous small grey, and sometimes red, **wooden** **windmills** are spread across Öland. The island has more windmills than any other region in the country.\n- Red brick chimneys with either a **crown-like** top or wide rectangular holes can be found close to lake Siljan in Dalarna county. It is somewhat common for these chimneys to be painted white.\n- Visby is the only preserved **Hanseatic town** in Sweden. The inner town can typically be recognised by the cobblestone streets, combined with the small, brightly painted stone houses and an abundance of roses following the house walls. It is also quite common to get a glimpse of the old Hanseatic wall surrounding the town.\n- The old town of Stockholm can be recognised by the old stone buildings, usually painted in warm colours, towering over the **narrow cobblestone alleyways**.\n- Many cities and towns have their own **local bus stop signs**, which are different from the signs in the rest of the region (as shown in the infographic in section 2). NOTE: The Växjö sign can also occasionally be found in Älmhult. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Neon-yellow** school bus stop signs are commonly found in the municipalities of Linköping, Norrköping and Jönköping.\n- If you see Västra Götaland bus stops combined with **three blue stripes** as shown in the picture, you are in Kungsbacka municipality. NOTE: These same stripes are found on bus stops in all of Halland.\n- Trams can be found mostly in **Gothenburg**, secondly in Norrköping and Stockholm, and rarely on Generation 4 coverage in Lund.\n- Black bus shelters with this specific design, mainly recognised by the square ridge along the back of the roof, can be found in Västerås and Umeå.\n- Street signs in Stockholm will have **two rows** divided by a black line and will usually **lack a black border**. Similar signs can also rarely be found in central Gävle. NOTE: Several suburbs in Stockholm use plain white street signs.\n- The entire city of Gothenburg uses these unique **blue** street signs. Note that they almost always have two lines. NOTE: Some other cities will have blue street signs near the centre, however they use a different design.\n- These somewhat old-looking, white street signs, with **black corners**, can be found all throughout Malmö.\n- Signs similar to the ones in Malmö, but with a **yellow background** can be found in Ystad.\n- Blue street signs similar to the ones found in Gothenburg can be found in Vellinge municipality. Note that these normally only have **one line**, compared to the two lines on Gothenburg street signs.\n- Plain, **yellow street signs** can be found in Falköping. Note that yellow street signs may very rarely be seen in other towns, however they will always have a distinctly brighter colour.\n- Blue street signs with a thin, **black outline **can be found in Köping.\n- Street names ending in **gattu** or **gatu** are found in central Dalarna, near lake Siljan. Notably, gattu is found in the south of this area, while gatu is found in the north.\n- Elfdalian is a language that is exclusively found in and around Älvdalen. It is most commonly seen on street signs, with street names typically ending in **“-ween”** or “-weg”.\n- **Three yellow stripes** can be found on signposts and street lamps in Karlstad as well as on traffic lights in Stockholm.\n- These **small yellow signs** advertising tree felling are commonly found on utility poles and lamp posts in the suburbs of Stockholm. While the phone code for Stockholm is usually written on the signs, it is often difficult to make out from a distance.\n- Sundsvall is known as **Drakstaden** (the Dragon City) in Sweden, which can be seen referenced in the form of dragon statues in the central parts of the city, and on signs.\n- The stretch of the **E4 between Umeå and the Finnish border** is one of very few roads in the northern parts of the country which is large enough to normally have either a wide ditch or a barrier between the carriageways. The area is fairly flat and the road is mainly surrounded by forests, mostly consisting of thin birches and pines, which get lower further north.\n- If you are in a mountainous area with orange snow poles that have **two wide reflectors close together**, you are very likely to be near the Norwegian border on, or close to road E12.\n- The stretch of road 95 closest to the Norwegian border can be recognized by a large number of **yellow snow poles**, all having two white reflectors. The coverage can be either Generation 2 in autumn or winter, or snowy Generation 4.\n- If you see a **mixture** of orange and yellow snow poles in a mountainous area, you should be on road E10 close to the Norwegian border.\n- Road 95 west of Arjeplog can be recognised by the Generation 4 **thawing snow** coverage in a **mountainous landscape**. The amount of snow significantly decreases as you go further east.\n- The city of Umeå has a lot of Generation 4 spring coverage, with dirty piles of **thawing snow** along almost every road. Almost no other city in the country has similar coverage.\n- The stretch of the E45 going between Orsa and Älvros can be recognised by the **brown-red wet pavement** with forest consisting of thin pines and birches along the roadside.\n- The island of Holmön has Generation 3 coverage, made by a white car with a long antenna, that features a distinctive **visual glitch**. NOTE: A similar glitch can be found elsewhere, however it should be less noticeable than on Holmön.\n- Foskrosvägen, on the border between Jämtland and Dalarna, can be recognised by the slightly red dirt on the road, combined with several **water smudges** on the camera. A good way to find the road when scanning is to look for the “Reindeer spot point” right on the county border."

                "description": "- By far the most important way to recognize Switzerland, is that all car coverage is **low-cam**. This means that the camera on the Google car is intentionally set up lower than in most other countries. This can be recognized in two ways: - The car blur is significantly bigger. - Roads look wider and objects around you are seen from a lower angle. Generally, the bigger car blur is the most consistent way to recognize low-cam. NOTE: The only other countries that always have low-cam are Japan and Liechtenstein.\n- Swiss **licence plates** differ substantially from other European plates. They are fully white and lack the blue strip found in most other European countries. **Front plates** are extremely short compared to most in Europe. **Rear plates** can be either long or tall. In both cases the red country emblem can be seen on the left, while the canton emblem can be seen on the right.\n- Swiss bollards are **black-and-white **with white or grey reflectors. They can be either wedge-shaped or cylindrical with a rounded top. NOTE: Liechtenstein uses almost identical round bollards.\n- The colour of **directional signs** indicates which type of road you are on. Main road signs will be blue, while side roads are white. Major place names will frequently appear on blue signs, while smaller places tend to be on white signs. However, you can still find large city names on a white sign.\n- Swiss pedestrian signs have **seven stripes**, making it almost unique for Europe. Furthermore, rather than the typical European square shape, the signs appear as tall blue rectangles. NOTE: Liechtenstein uses identical signs.\n- **Long dashed yellow** road lines are a good clue for Switzerland. NOTE: These road lines are also common in Liechtenstein.\n- Pedestrian crossings are typically painted **yellow** and exclusive to Switzerland and Liechtenstein within Europe.\n- Swiss road signs commonly have a round, grey **metal border** around them. NOTE: Liechtenstein uses almost identical directional signs. Somewhat similar metal borders are found on some directional signs in Denmark.\n- Town entry signs in Switzerland are usually **white or blue**, with a **metal frame** around them. NOTE: On the back of these signs you may often find the distance to larger, nearby cities. Furthermore, the abbreviation for the canton can often be seen on the bottom of the sign, especially when the town is situated near a canton border.\n- **Chevrons** are black with a white arrow. You may also rarely find chevrons that are white with a black arrow. NOTE: Austrian chevrons are red and white, or red and yellow.\n- While the southern half of Switzerland is extremely mountainous, with long, thin valleys between the mountains, the northern half mostly consists of large farmlands on either flat ground or rolling hills, typically with forested hills in the distance.\n- Swiss and Alpine architecture in general largely consists of **stone buildings** painted in light and warm colours, often combined with wooden parts and details. Roofs are typically tiled and of a gable type. It is extremely common for windows to have wooden shutters which open horizontally in two parts.\n- These bus stop signs, with thick **metal signposts** going around them, are unique to Switzerland."

Note that some areas, mostly near the region borders, are bilingual. NOTE: Unlike Germany and Austria, Swiss German does not use the letter **ß**.\n- The text on the **speed limit signs** varies depending on the official languages in the region.\n- **Cantons** are the first-level administrative division of Switzerland. It is very common to find the two-letter abbreviation for the canton that you are in, as seen on some town entry signs. As such, remembering these can be a great asset when region-guessing Switzerland. NOTE: If you happen to come across an unblurred licence plate, the first two letters will correspond to the canton that it is registered in.\n- The first digits of Swiss postal codes are a good way to regionguess the country. The general pattern is that the numbers increase from the west to east.\n- **Elevation** is an important part of region-guessing Switzerland. The southern half of Switzerland is extremely mountainous, while the northern half mostly has smaller mountains and hills.\n- A fairly flat landscape with a long chain of medium-sized, forested mountains northwest means you are likely south of the Jura Mountains.\n- **Exposed limestone rocks**, protruding from forested hills, are commonly found in the Jura mountains.\n- **Rock walls** are mainly found in the Jura mountains, but can also be found in the Alps, particularly in the Italian speaking parts.\n- Not unexpectedly, seeing typical **Italian architecture** in Switzerland should imply that you are in the Italian-speaking areas in the south, principally the canton of Ticino. The architectural style is characterized by, typically very smooth, orange-yellow stone walls with multiple floors and orange or brownish tiled roofs. Green and brown Italian-style window shutters are common.\n- Large houses with thick roofs, which are shaped like an **arch** **underneath**, are common around Bern.\n- **Elaborate timber frames**, which are commonly painted red, are found in the northeast. NOTE: Simpler timber frames in other colours can be found in other parts of the country.\n- Around Appenzell, most houses will consist of a large living house connected to a long barn, such that the roof of the living house and the barn are at a **90° angle**. The front facade of the living house will often be divided into small squares, with each window being perfectly contained within a square.\n- In the canton of Graubünden, you will often come across houses entirely made of stone, with, most commonly white, **decorative painted details** around windows and the edges of the house.\n- These **large** town entry signs can sometimes be found in the canton of Vaud.\n- **Olive green infrastructure**, particularly signposts, sign borders and sign backs, are found in Basel-Landschaft.\n- In the canton of Valais, you will often see thick wooden bollards, which can either be **square-shaped** or **cylindrical**.\n- In place of bollards, reflectors in the canton of Glarus will often be **attached to fences** following the road.\n- In Geneva and in the valley between Martigny and Lake Geneva, you can find bike path symbols painted on the road with a **simplified person** on top of two **disconnected wheels**. NOTE: This stands in contrast to the rest of the country, where the symbol will be a somewhat detailed bike.\n- You may find several different types of **road dividers** across the country, distributed as seen in this graphic. _This image was provided by quarksauce.

NOTE: Due to the low-lying landscape, you will probably be fairly close to the shore if you see the lake.\n- The valley of Martigny has the highest density of **fruit plantations** in the country. It can easily be recognized by the many small fruit trees in combination with the wide, flat valley with large mountains on either side.\n- Apart from the valley of Martigny, the most likely area to find **fruit trees** is near Lake Constance, followed by the area northwest of Lake Geneva.\n- In the canton of Graubünden, you can find this unique and easily recognizable **train coverage** on the tracks of the “Bernina Express.” It runs around most of the canton, all the way down to Tirano in Italy.\n- **Generation 2** coverage is very limited in Switzerland. It can be found mostly near the border between the cantons of Bern and Valais, and on a few very short stretches in Schaffhausen. NOTE: This does not include the many ski resorts with Generation 2 snow coverage, which can be found throughout the southern half of the country.\n- These blue street signs, with **rounded edges** on the sides, are unique to the city of Sankt Gallen.\n- Large blue street signs, attached to a **low double signpost**, similar to directional signs in Denmark, are found in Basel.\n- Downtown Bern can be recognized by this **specific architecture**. Grey toned buildings, typically with four floors and large, somewhat rounded openings lined up on the ground floor are common."

NOTE: Hong Kong also uses traditional Chinese characters on signage. !!Japanese uses some Chinese characters (kanji), meaning the script can look somewhat similar. However, Japanese will also have a considerable amount of more simplified looking characters (katakana and hiragana).\n- Poles almost always feature these **black and yellow** diagonal-striped markings that run all the way to the bottom. NOTE: Similar markings can be seen in South Korea. However, the markings are much shorter and do not run all the way to the bottom.\n- Taiwan drives on the **right** side of the road. NOTE: Japan and Hong Kong drive on the left.\n- Roads in Taiwan generally feature **double yellow** middle lines with single white outer lines. Thinner roads sometimes use single dashed yellow lines instead.\n- Roads with outside white road lines and **no middle lines** at all are common. In the absence of better clues, this type of road line can be a very good way to identify Taiwan.\n- **Red outer lines** that indicate no parking are common in Taiwan, especially in cities. This is essentially unique to the country.\n- Taiwan uses **black on yellow** chevrons.\n- These **mirrors with orange hoods** are frequently featured in intersections and bends.\n- Taiwan uses these bollards with either two or three **circular reflectors** on a black rectangle. You can also find these **lollipop** looking reflectors on guardrails, similar to the designs found in Japan.\n- **Concrete drainage ditches** are commonly found on the side of roads.\n- These **distribution transformers** that look like boxes are frequently found in Taiwan, especially in urban areas.They are mostly painted in dark green or grey.\n- Architecture in Taiwan varies in designs, ranging from cramped, multiple-story housing to flat, single-story houses with backyards. Many residential buildings have a very **boxy** look. A lot of walls are covered in **tiles**, usually white. Sheds made out of tin are also featured, commonly painted in a light green colour.\n- In Generation 3 coverage, you can find this **black car with a long antenna** and a red brake light in the middle, similar to the one you can see in Russia.\n- You can also find this Generation 3 car with a **very large blur** that covers the entire car and almost looks like low-cam. Note that this is not the same as low-cam: the camera is still at a normal height, meaning you see the world around you from a normal vantage point."

                "description": "- This is a map of the **counties of Taiwan**. Importantly, Taiwan has a couple of smaller islands and island groups with coverage that are fairly far away from the main island. It is important to be aware of these, as they often catch beginning players off-guard. These include: - Kinmen close to the coast of mainland China. - Lienchiang (Matsu Islands), also close to the coast of mainland China. - Penghu in the middle of the Taiwan Strait. - Green Island and Orchid Island, southeast of the main island. These two islands belong to Taitung County.\n- Taiwan telephone numbers are 10 digits, with the first two digits indicating the **area code**. Area codes range from 02 to 08, increasing as you go south. NOTE: Oftentimes the area code will be written within parentheses. Mobile numbers start with 09.\n- Taiwan’s **National Freeway system** is organised so that odd numbers represent north-south roads and even numbers represent east-west. Generally, numbers also increase moving west to east and north to south. The 1 and the 3 are by far the longest, running across the west coast. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- These signs indicate Township roads, with the character written **before** or **above** the road number indicating the county. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Many poles in Taiwan feature these **blue plaques** with strings of letters and numbers that act as precise coordinates. For an example of how to read the plaques in-game, the only thing that is useful here is the string “E3264”. “BE08” can further narrow down the position but is not practical in-game. “E” refers to the 50x80km rectangle from this map. “3264” means that within the rectangle, we are 32% eastward and 64% northward. This article explains how the string “BE08” can be further used to narrow down the exact coordinates of the telephone pole.\n- The central western plain of Taiwan mainly consists of **flat** to low rolling plains. It is common to find crops and other farmland in this area.\n- The central-eastern region that covers two-thirds of Taiwan consists of **forested mountains**. The central mountain range that runs all the way to the south of the island is made up of tall mountains and rugged valleys. At high elevations, the vegetation can look **less tropical** and feature temperate or even coniferous trees.\n- The **Hualien-Taitung Valley** is a thin and long valley located on the east coast of the island passing from Hualien City at the north to Taitung City at the south. It is very recognizable as it consists of flat gentle plains surrounded by densely-forested mountains to the east and west. NOTE: Most of the coverage on the east coast lies within this valley. There are also other valleys in central Taiwan that can look similar.\n- The **Yilan Plain** is easily identifiable by the mountain ranges that are seen in the north, west, and south. Rice paddies are also extremely common as well as houses built right next to these fields. NOTE: While the landscape on the surface can look quite similar to the valleys of Hualien and Taitung, unlike those two, you will almost never find mountains to the **east** in the plains of Yilan. Furthermore, the flat plains of Yilan are also generally more open.\n- The island of Kinmen can be recognized by these trees with **fuzzy leaves** lining the road and **red-tinged** soil. NOTE: There is no Generation 4 coverage in Kinmen.\n- Miaoli and Hsinchu share a landscape of **low rolling hills** and winding roads as well as sparse farmland with vegetation that can look messy and unkempt.\n- Similarly, Taichung features these open plains surrounded by **low mountains** that are often in the distance.\n- Areca catechu, also known as **areca palms** or betel nut palms, are extensively found in central and southern Taiwan. Areca palms are most common in the **mountainous** regions of Taiwan, you can still see dense areca palm patches in northern counties but they are few and far between.\n- **Coconut palms** (Cocos nucifera) are primarily found in the southern-half of the island, toward the coast.\n- **Norfolk island pines** (Araucaria heterophylla) are extremely common in the county of Penghu, especially in tightly-packed rows next to roads. NOTE: While these trees can be found on the main island as well, they are usually never found in such close proximity.\n- These **leafless** trees are most frequently seen in Penghu.\n- **Cultivated fish farms** are mostly found right next to the coast in the western counties.They are generally seen in the southern-half of the island, anywhere from Changhua to Pingtung, but predominantly found in the counties of Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung.\n- **Tea plantations** are generally seen in mountainous areas all over Taiwan. You can find them commonly in Chiayi, Nantou, Hsinchu, and Miaoli.\n- These **areca palm plantations** are mostly found in the county of Pingtung. NOTE: Plantations in Pingtung are mainly found in neat, organised rows like these, in the flat plains. While in most central and southern counties, they will be found in the mountainous areas. Additionally, the counties further north will also rarely have areca palms in the flat plains of the west coast.\n- Old and **disorganised** housing units as well as tall **dingy-looking** apartment blocks are frequently seen in the urban areas of northern Taiwan.\n- Taoyuan features these **red brick** and sometimes red tile apartment buildings. NOTE: They can also be commonly spotted in the greater Taipei area and rarely in other urban areas but are most common in Taoyuan.\n- In Yilan, you can find these **rich multiple-story villas**.They come in all types of designs and are often gated.\n- White-tinged **cream coloured houses** are frequently seen in Penghu.\n- You can find these small, **traditional-looking** houses in Kinmen.\n- Similar to the blue plaques found on utility poles, Taiwan also features **stickers** to ID the locations of **lamps**. These can be found on both lampposts and utility poles with lamps attached to them. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Pavement with **white speckles** is commonly found along the east coast.\n- Kinmen often features lampposts with **red and white** diagonal stripes. NOTE: Red and white striped markings are also found on the main island, especially in cities and urban areas.\n- Similarly, lampposts with **red and white** diagonal stripes on a **trapezoidal** base are frequently found in Kaohsiung City.\n- In Yunlin, you can find poles with a **thicker support** below the pole top.\n- These **green square stickers** are typically seen on every pole in Chiayi City.\n- These **bent** sign and chevron holders with two **black and yellow**-striped stickers are only found in Pingtung, Kaohsiung, and Taitung.\n- Distribution transformers **raised** **by a dark green holder** are mostly found in New Taipei City and Keelung City.\n- **Blue outer lines** are almost entirely exclusive to Penghu."

Additionally, it is common to find run-down, **concrete** pavement. NOTE: While the landscape between Green Island and Orchid Island are quite similar, a good way to distinguish the two is that Green Island frequently uses **yellow outer lines**. Additionally, Green Island is slightly more built-up.\n- Lienchiang County, also referred to as the Matsu Islands, is recognizable from the hilly landscape and frequent use of **concrete roads**. The coverage is **overcast** and this pavement can also commonly be found.\n- The Provincial Highway 8 that runs from Taichung to Hualien is very recognizable, specifically in the Hualien part, due to the **yellow guardrail** that can be found all throughout the western half of the road in the county. The eastern half of the road features these tall exposed-rock cliffs that tower over the road.\n- The Provincial Highway 20, specifically the part that runs through **Yushan National Park**, features tall mountains covered with coniferous trees. The road also utilises these tube-like double guardrails. NOTE: This road is only covered in Generation 2 and 4. The Generation 4 coverage is very overexposed and features sunny weather.\n- The road that leads up to Taipingshan National Forest in Yilan is distinct due to it often being **very foggy** when covered. Other features of this road include the coniferous trees and a guardrail with red legs. NOTE: Certain parts of the roads feature a sunset in Generation 3.\n- This open landscape with forests of **short trees** surrounding a narrow **grassy road** can be found in Hualien in the flat parts of Guangfu and Fenglin. This area can be distinguished due to it being commonly covered in Generation 2; however, you can find similar landscapes in Generation 3 and 4.\n- A **green train car** can be found in east Chiayi around Alishan National Forest.\n- A **blue pickup truck** can be seen in a few of the riverside parks in Taipei City."

This guide only discusses the trekkers and tripods. For the spills, see our spillover guide. It should be noted that none of the trekkers and tripods are pinpointable, or even on a road, and therefore they typically do not appear in serious competitive maps. This guide describes them primarily for the sake of completeness. The spills however do appear in maps from time to time. Due to the sparse nature of the coverage, that is also entirely not on any streets, it is not useful to learn any territory identification metas. Instead, it is better to just memorise what the trekkers and tripods look like."

As a result, this coverage has a distinct ethereal look, compared to normal street view: objects in the image will usually have motion blur, and slightly saturated colours. NOTE: Tripods can also be found in several other countries.\n- The Mount Kilimanjaro tripods show a **high altitude landscape**, with dark grey rock and in some places eternal snow in the distance. In some panos, you will see mountaineers and tents.\n- A walking trekker goes through a large part of Gombe National Park. The landscape varies somewhat from place to place. In the lowland parts, you will see **dense jungle** and usually very little sunlight, leading to dark coverage. Sometimes, you can see **chimpanzees**.\n- Higher up on the hills, the forest becomes more open and you will see **savannah-like trees** around you.\n- On top of the hills, the trees make way for a bare **grassland** landscape. Here, you have breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape and Lake Tanganyika.\n- There is a **boat trekker** in Lake Tanganyika, that hugs the coast very closely, next to Gombe National Park. The coast is always to your east. You will see hills that are mostly covered in tropical forest, with some bare and grassy hilltops. You can see the boat through the blur: it is painted **olive green and white**, and has some people in it. The boat and people are always pixelated due to the blur. NOTE: Do not confuse this boat trekker with the boats in Madagascar.\n- There is one more tripod in Tanzania, inside Jane Goodall’s house.

These can have place names. When they do not, you will see them as just the road number with a Garuda. Moreover, highway signs are **green**, and frequently feature the place names in Latin script below the Thai name.\n- Stop signs in Thailand feature the **Thai script**, instead of Latin. NOTE: Stop signs in Laos feature the Lao script, similar to Thai, but they have just 2 characters instead of 3.\n- These two road markers are generally found in Thailand. They will either have a white or a black **Garuda** on them. NOTE: White Garudas are found on country roads and appear white on the map, while black ones are found on province roads and appear dark blue on the map.

The dry season in Thailand can typically be recognized by a haze in the sky due to wildfires.\n- During the **wet season**, the majority of **rice **cultivation occurs in the eastern plains.\n- Over 90% of the palm oil in Thailand is produced in the south. This means that **palm plantations** are most often seen in southern Thailand.\n- Dense plantations of** short **or **medium sized coconut palms** are most commonly found west** **of Bangkok.\n- Slightly less dense plantations of **tall coconut palms **are most common in Prachuap Khiri Khan. NOTE: The entire peninsula will have many coconut palms, this tip only refers to plantations.\n- Large numbers of **palmyra palms** are typically found near the eastern coast of the peninsula, specifically just south of Bangkok as well as in the far south.

It** **can be found throughout most of Thailand, but is considerably more common in the central and northeastern plains.\n- **Corn **is most commonly found in the north and central** **regions of Thailand.\n- The most extensive **fruit plantations** can be found in the valley between Chiang Mai and Lamphun** **as well as eastern Sa Kaeo and Chanthaburi.\n- **Durian plantations** are most common around Chanthaburi, but can be found around the peninsula and other areas. When they are young, they can be identified by their cone-shaped appearance. When fully grown, durian trees can be identified by their dark bark, branches that nearly reach the ground, and oblong leaves with pointed tips.\n- **Pineapple plantations **are most commonly found southeast and southwest** **of Bangkok.\n- **Eucalyptus plantations** are most common around Sa Kaeo. NOTE: Eucalyptus can be found in smaller quantities, such as lining the road, in different areas. This tip is exclusively about dense plantations.\n- Tectona grandis, also known as **teak**, is most commonly found in high densities in the north. It can be recognized by its large leaves and yellow flowers. NOTE: Teak trees are often used for decoration along highways.\n- **Pine trees**, specifically Pinus latteri, or Tenasserim pines, are more or less exclusive to the north and northwest of the country.\n- Codiaeum variegatum, also known as **garden croton**, is a decorative plant recognised by its yellow, orange and red leaves. It is most common around Ranong and other coastal provinces.\n- **Gray corrugated metal roofs** are most commonly found in the north and south** **of the country, but can occasionally be found throughout the country.\n- Regular poles with a Chilean style **indent **are found around Bangkok.

NOTE: Military plates feature a small Tunisian flag on the left side of the plate, which is visible on the dark green follow car.\n- One of the best ways to recognize Tunisia is that, in most coverage, the Google car is escorted by a **follow car**. There are several different follow cars and these are four of the most commonly found ones. NOTE: Follow cars can be in front of the street view car, or very far behind. Make sure to pan and zoom if you do not find them immediately.\n- The Google car in Tunisia is **black** with a medium-length, thin antenna. NOTE: The colour of the car is not always perceptible. Make sure to look around for other more helpful clues.\n- Tunisia has Mediterranean, dry and semidesert climates. NOTE: In the second step, you will find more about region specific climate and landscape.\n- These **olive tree plantations** can often be found along roads. They consist of nicely arranged rows of olive trees on an often raked, weedless soil.\n- Tunisia usually has white road lines. Outer road lines can be dashed or solid. NOTE: A few roads in Sfax have yellow middle lines.\n- In Tunisia, both **French and Arabic** are common. The Arabic script can be identified by its lines and dots. You can often see bilingual signs. NOTE: The UAE and (more rarely) Jordan use English and Arabic.\n- Most direction signs have a **white** background with towns listed in Arabic and Latin script. The font of the Latin script is usually quite distinctive. NOTE: Many direction signs include the capital Tunis, but this does not necessarily mean you are anywhere near that city.\n- Doors, windows, gates and other architectural elements are sometimes painted with this specific traditional **shade of blue**. NOTE: This shade of blue can be found all over the country, but is especially common on the island of Djerba, where buildings tend to be older and more traditional.\n- **Red and white** striped curbs are common in Tunisia. NOTE: Similar curbs are also common in Israel and Palestine. Make sure to look for additional information!\n- These white concrete markers with a rounded red or yellow top can be found throughout Tunisia. The top can be red, yellow, or green. NOTE: They are very useful for pinpointing your exact location. On either side, they show the **distance in kilometres to the nearest town.** The side facing the road shows the road number.\n- Tunisia has a fairly unique **stop sign** with Arabic and Latin script. NOTE: Similar stop signs can be found in Jordan and the UAE. However, Israel and Palestine use a different unique stop sign with a hand instead of text."

The biggest towns and the island of Djerba have quite extensive side road coverage.\n- This **light green Toyota** follow car can be found everywhere in the northernmost part of Tunisia. You will never see it south of Hammamet.\n- The **dark green Mazda** is the most common follow car in Tunisia. This becomes apparent if you look at the coverage map, it can be found all the way from Hammamet to Djerba. Aside from the darker colour, it can also be recognized by its military licence plate with a **red strip** on the left.\n- Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, has **a lot of different follow cars**. Most of them can be found all over the city. The light green Toyota can also be spotted here.\n- The city of Kairouan in central-northern Tunisia has this unique follow car, a **white Mitsubishi** with white mirrors. The dark green follow car can also sometimes be spotted following the Mitsubishi. NOTE: Some white follow cars in Tunisia can look similar to the Kairouan car. However, none of them are Mitsubishis.\n- The island of Djerba is the only region of Tunisia where you are usually **not** accompanied by a follow car. Most coverage completely lacks one. While it is rare, this **white Mercedes** and the dark green follow car can be present.\n- The area north of Tunis has a Mediterranean climate with hilly terrain. The region is very agricultural and at the time the coverage was captured, almost all fields laid fallow.\n- The area between Tunis and Hammamet looks similar to the area north of Tunis, but the hills tend to be higher and more vegetated.\n- The large middle region between Hammamet and Gabes is very flat, and more arid. Olive tree plantations are common and the more south you go, the drier the landscape becomes.\n- South of Gabes is where the landscape changes into something more akin to a desert. A lot more rubbish and small white rocks can be found along the roads. Olive tree plantations are still somewhat common. A mountain range far in the distance is often visible to the southwest.\n- The island of Djerba can sometimes have a distinct vibe. There tend to be a lot of palm trees. Whitewashed, traditional buildings with blue doors and windows are common. NOTE: Not all locations on the island will have this distinct vibe. A lack of a follow car is another good way to confirm that you are on Djerba."

NOTE: While Djerba also has many palm trees, the towns and surrounding area tend to look more rural.\n- On the P1 road northwest of Medinine, you can occasionally find sandy hills that look like this. These hills are quite unique, as most coverage in southern Tunisia is in very flat areas.\n- An offroad from road P12 southwest of Sousse can be recognised by the dark pavement surrounded by bright sandy soil combined with the east-west road angle. The eastern part of the road is fairly vegetated, with large numbers of prickly pears, while the western part of the road is very arid with little to no vegetation.\n- You can easily recognise the Djerba-Zarzis causeway thanks to the **water on both sides** and the **pipeline** that is always present to your west.\n- Trekkers can be found all over the country, even in places far away from the area with car coverage.

It uses the following special characters: - Ç ç and Ş ş with a cedilla (“hook” below the letter). - Ö ö and Ü ü with an umlaut) (two dots). - Ğ ğ with a breve. - Dotless I ı. This letter in particular is noteworthy, as it is essentially unique to Turkish. In case you are confused: this is similar to the letter i, but without a dot when written in lowercase. - Capital İ with a dot.\n- Turkish **bollards** have a simple design: rectangular, plain white, and with a red reflector on the front. They are thin when seen from the side. NOTE: Romania has similar bollards. However, bollards are relatively rare in Romania.\n- The colour of Turkish road lines is somewhat inconsistent. Most roads simply have white road lines. However, it is not uncommon to see yellow road lines. These roads can have fully yellow lines, or a combination of yellow and white lines.\n- Many roads have pavement with a grainy “**salt and pepper**” texture.\n- **Divided highways** are extremely common, especially compared to other Mediterranean countries.\n- Turkish chevrons are typically **red on white**. Beware that there are some other regional variants. Usually, the tip of the arrow does not touch the edge of the chevron. Some chevrons have a neon yellow border.\n- On intersections, you can often find this distinctive **black and yellow** chevron, with multiple arrows that point upward.\n- Sometimes, you can see these **narrow chevrons** that have a red and white colour scheme. NOTE: Almost identical chevrons can be found in South Africa.\n- Direction signs use a very distinct font that can often be recognised by the noticeably **wide letter spaces**.\n- Snow poles usually feature a colour sequence of black-orange-black-white from top to bottom, with small red reflectors.\n- Stop signs have the word “**DUR**” written on them. This is unique to Turkey.\n- Turkey uses both main types of guardrails: - A-type guardrails, which have **rounded** edges. - B-type guardrails, which have **square** edges. While most Mediterranean countries use the A-type, B-type can help solve some tough 50-50s. Furthermore, seeing both types will exclude all southern European and Middle Eastern countries, other than Montenegro and Israel & the West Bank. For a full overview of which guardrails are found in which European country, see this infographic.\n- Metal poles, either in the shape of a **ladder** or with a **mesh** pattern, are extremely common in Turkey.\n- In the **Generation 3** coverage, the Google car **never has an antenna**.\n- The **Generation 4** coverage in Turkey typically features a **white Google car**. Usually, only a tiny sliver of the back of the car is visible. The car can have a short antenna, or no antenna at all.\n- A **grey pickup truck** can be found in some Generation 4 coverage. NOTE: Similar pickup trucks can also be found in Senegal and Kenya.\n- Turkey also has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot.\n- The Turkish landscape ranges from arid in the southeast to a Mediterranean landscape in the southwest. In the north you will often find a more forested and lush landscape. The most typical landscape is semi-arid, either rolling or flat, with vast agricultural fields, containing very limited vegetation other than crops. Beware that Turkey is a very naturally diverse country with many landscapes that are not mentioned in this tip.\n- Tall and somewhat square **apartment blocks** are very common in Turkey.\n- Turkey is a muslim country, and as such mosques can be found in most towns. In particular, tall **minarets** are extremely common and a good clue for the country.\n- **Brick pavement** is very common in urban areas, and the bricks will typically have the shape shown in the image."

Most notably, the first digit of area codes are ordered from 2 in the west to 4 in the east. NOTE: Phone codes starting with 5 are not regional.\n- Turkey has three main types of numbered roads. The largest type are the **O-roads**, which on kilometre markers feature an O followed by a hyphen and the road number. The second largest type are the **D-roads**, which omit the “D” on kilometre markers and instead only feature a 3-digit road number, followed by the road section number on the top and the kilometre at the bottom. The section number will generally increase to the southeast.\n- The third type of roads are provincial roads. While these generally aren’t labelled on the map, they can still be used to regionguess since the kilometre markers feature the **provincial code** as the first two digits on the sign. These codes generally increase alphabetically from 01 to 76 with some newer regions being unordered. Shown in the image is a road from the Afyon Province (03).\n- Generation 4 **truck coverage** is mainly found in the far east of the country and along the southern coast, with smaller pockets in the west and around Kastamonu. For a more detailed look, see this document.\n- Northern Turkey tends to be significantly **lusher** and **more forested** than the rest of the country.\n- In the northeast you will find **uncultivated grasslands** in valleys surrounded by round hills. Trees are very limited in the region. In Generation 3 the area has an extremely distinct look, with deep green grass covering the hills. It is significantly more difficult to recognise in Generation 4, where the grass has a more arid look.\n- **Turkish pines** (pinus brutia) are mainly found near the Mediterranean coast. NOTE: Turkish pines can appear very similar to Aleppo pines, which are uncommon in Turkey, but are often found in other Mediterranean countries.\n- **Tea plantations** are common in the province of Rize.\n- **Olive trees** are mainly found on the Mediterranean coast.\n- **Sunflowers** are mainly found in northwestern Turkey.\n- A majority of all **vineyards** in Turkey can be found in a region east of Izmir.\n- **Cotton** is mainly found in the region surrounding the city of Şanlıurfa.\n- Lake Van is by far the biggest lake in Turkey and has a semi-arid landscape, being surrounded by dry grassy hills and occasional trees and agricultural fields near the shore.\n- Dark, **volcanic rocks** are commonly found between the cities of Şanlıurfa and Diyarbakır.\n- River valleys surrounded by steep, **barren and rocky cliff sides** can be found between the cities of Erzurum and Artvin and in the southeast near the city of Hakkâri.\n- **Tiled roofs** are mostly found in the western two thirds of the country. Note that for this and the following roof-related tips to be reliable, the majority of all visible roofs should preferably be of that type.\n- **Flat roofs** are mostly found in the southeast and to a lesser extent along the south coast.\n- **Metal roofs** are most common in the east.\n- Sheet metal roofs shaped like **low pyramids** are mainly found far east, particularly in the general area surrounding Lake Van.\n- Many buildings in the Nevşehir Province are built by large, light and unevenly coloured, **sandstone bricks**.\n- **Yellow on black chevrons** are mainly found in and around the Balıkesir Province in the west and in the Kars Province in the far east. Beware that you may very rarely find them elsewhere.\n- **Black on yellow chevrons** are mainly found north of Izmir.\n- Four-lane divided highways with **no divider**, other than double middle road lines, are almost exclusively found in the eastern half of the country. Beware that divided highways with clear dividers, such as guardrails, can still be found in the east.\n- **Vertical water tanks** can be found in most of Turkey, but are notably uncommon along the south and west coast.\n- Horizontal water tanks placed **on top of** vertical water tanks are primarily found in a line following the south coast and going up to Elâzığ.\n- **Square water tanks** with angled corners are found in the south, approximately from İskenderun to Sanliurfa.\n- White **spherical water tanks** can be found in the southeast, mainly south of Batman.\n- In the European part of Turkey, except Istanbul, utility poles, and other electrical infrastructure, will have a 6 digit code, which is often seen on a small pole plate under the yellow electricity warning plate.\n- Street signs in the Ankara Province are blue with a small **round top**. Similar street signs can very rarely be found in Giresun. Beware that some newer street signs are red.\n- Street signs in the Izmir Province are dark blue, noticeably **bulge outwards** and very commonly have the **emblem** of Izmir in white at the top of the sign.\n- If you find yourself surrounded by **greenhouses**, you are likely to be along the south coast west of Adana."

It is often seen together with Küçük Ağrı, a smaller volcano to the southeast.\n- **Banana plants** are found around the city of Alanya.\n- Road E99 south of Şanlıurfa is a divided highway which can be recognised by the slightly hazy Generation 4 sunrise coverage combined with the flat agricultural landscape and general south-north road angle.\n- Road D525 south of Söke is a completely straight road going south-south-west to north-north-east with winter Generation 3 coverage. Along the road you will typically find a large amount of reed.\n- Along the western shore of Lake Beyşehir and Lake Eğirdir you can find this small single lane road with jagged, exposed rock and Turkish pines to the west. These two can be differentiated by the road west of Lake Eğirdir having a middle road line.\n- These light blue and grey **touristic signs** which are either arrow shaped or rectangular with a half circle on the top can be found on the island of Bozcaada.\n- Red street signs with a coloured bottom strip are found in several cities. In the bottom right corner, you can find a white arrow and some numbers. If this arrow is pointing in **both directions** and has a **single arrowhead**, rather than double, then you are almost certainly in Istanbul. Beware that simple arrows pointing in only one direction can be found in both Istanbul and in other cities. However, if you see such signs in combination with red house numbers, then you should be in Istanbul.\n- Street signs in Trabzon and Yalvaç are **red** and **oval-shaped**. House numbers also feature the same design.\n- Street signs in Bursa are **green**, and generally have slightly **extruded letters**, meaning the signs are not completely flat. NOTE: Several other types of infrastructure in Bursa, such as fences and guardrails, may also be coloured green.\n- Street signs in Bolu are also **green**, but are **completely flat** and lack any kind of border."

Like many African countries, houses will often be surrounded by tall walls, commonly with barbed wire on top.\n- Like most of the national park coverage, Kampalan soil is typically very **red**. Even paved roads normally have a noticeable red, purple or pink tinge.\n- Kampala is a very **hilly **city, and as such it is rare to get a round without elevation or noticeable hills.\n- Throughout Kampala, you will often see these **taxi buses**, with a blue blocky pattern on the sides. These are a good clue for the city if you are not able to see the Google car.\n- In the **city centre** of Kampala, you will see paved roads with black-and-white curbs.

The most recognizable mountain range can be seen to the east and is visible in most of the coverage.\n- The southern half of the north road in Kidepo is somewhat **forested**, and as such it may occasionally be hard to see the various mountains.\n- The northern half of the north road in Kidepo is located in a savannah and can be easily recognised by the **wide mountain** to the north.\n- The National Park is located by the northern end of Lake Albert and can commonly be recognized by the low** dirt barriers** along the side of the roads. A savannah can be seen in the western part, while the eastern parts contain many small trees and bushes. Apart from a fairly low and wide mountain range far away to the west, there are no mountains in the vicinity.\n- Seeing these **palms** in Uganda means you are extremely likely to be in the northern parts of Murchison Falls.\n- The National Park has three types of coverage, the first of which is a very **wide dirt road** going through a dense, tropical forest. It is by far the widest dirt road in the country outside of Kampala with Street View coverage.\n- The second type of coverage in Kibale is on a **small forest road**, which is still large enough to be covered using a car. The forest appears to be quite dense, however it is typically not very dark. The area is mostly flat.\n- The final type of coverage is a number of **tiny forest paths**.

The grass is almost always completely dried out, which is normally enough to recognise it. Bushes and trees along the road also typically look very dry. The area is quite hilly, but not mountainous.\n- The coverage in the national park consists of two small forest paths running parallel to each other. The forest appears very humid, and on much of the coverage, **drops of water** can be seen on the camera lens.\n- The national park is located near the Kenyan border and has two stretches of paths covered, the first of which is in a **forest **with a fairly steep slope heading upwards to the east. The dirt typically has a very dark red colour.\n- The eastern stretch of path covered is easily recognized by its small **palm-like** trees on an open hilly field and a man following the photographer, who is dressed in green and holding a **rifle**.\n- Queen Elizabeth National Park, north of Lake Edward, is one of the only places in Uganda where you will commonly see dirt which is **not red**. Instead, the dirt will typically be either **brown **or **greyish**.\n- On top of the brown dirt, the national park also contains **large cacti** with many branches going almost straight upwards, resembling the shape of trees.\n- On the northern coverage, it is common to see large, **water-filled craters**. Similar craters cannot be found elsewhere in the country.\n- The **only paved road** with coverage outside Kampala can be found here. The pavement almost entirely lacks the red tinge which is typical for most roads in the country. The road has white, solid outer lines and a yellow middle line. A power line runs parallel to the road, to your east. To your north, you will be able to see hills.\n- **Katwe village** is the only significant settlement outside of Kampala with Street View coverage. NOTE: Much smaller villages, safari lodges and single houses with coverage can be found elsewhere."

                "description": "- Ukraine uses long, white licence plates, with a distinctive **blue and yellow** strip on the left (the colours of the flag). You may also come across older plates, where the blue and yellow are difficult to spot. NOTE: Russia uses fully white licence plates, without a strip on the left.\n- All coverage in Ukraine is Generation 3. Most of it was made using a **red Google car**. This car is almost unique to Ukraine. It sometimes has an antenna, and sometimes no antenna. Note that the car is not always visible, though at times you will still be able to tell its colour due to the car blur glitch. NOTE: The car meta can be very useful to tell Ukraine and Russia apart: - Most importantly, you will not find the red Generation 3 car in Russia. - Russia can have Generation 4 (and sometimes Generation 2). Ukraine never has either Generation. - Russian Generation 3 cars always have either a short or long antenna. If you see no antenna at all, consider Ukraine. Also note that some parts of Belgium can have a red google car with a long antenna.\n- More rarely, you can also find several other Google cars in Ukraine: - Black car with a long antenna - White car with a long antenna - Grey car with a short antenna These cars can be found in multiple countries, including Russia. See the region guessing section to see where you can find these cars within Ukraine.\n- On average, Ukraine has some of the **worst roads** in Europe. Most rural roads have lots of potholes, cracks and warped pavement. This abysmal road quality can really help with tough 50-50s with Russia, which generally has somewhat better roads.\n- Many random streetside objects are painted in the **colours of the Ukrainian flag**: blue and yellow. Most commonly, you will see fences that have this colour.\n- The Ukrainian language uses the **Cyrillic** script. These letters are unique to Ukrainian, compared to Russian: - Є є (not to be confused with Э э in Russian and Belarusian.) - Ґ ґ - І і - Ї ї NOTE: Other European languages that use Cyrillic include Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Macedonian.\n- The Ukrainian word for street is **вулиця** (vulytsya), abbreviated **вул.** (vul.). The Russian word is улица, abbreviated ул., without a в at the beginning.\n- The Ukrainian word for city is **місто** (misto), abbreviated **м.** (m.). It can be used both to differentiate it from other cyrillic languages and to quickly find the city name in addresses.\n- Ukraine primarily uses **square concrete poles**. They can have a variety of different pole tops, and sometimes have white paint at the bottom. These poles are similar to the ones found in other post-Soviet countries like Russia and Lithuania.\n- Poles often have **diagonal support beams**.\n- You can also find wooden poles, sometimes with **concrete support blocks** at their base.\n- Ukraine uses a **red chevron with white arrows**. Russia and Estonia use the same chevrons.\n- Ukrainian pedestrian signs have **three stripes**. Russia, Estonia and Lithuania also use pedestrian signs with three stripes.\n- Ukraine uses **white** town entry signs.\n- Guardrails and barriers will often be painted **black and white**, similar to Russia.\n- In bigger cities and towns, you will often see big **Soviet-era apartment blocks**. These are often made of light grey brick. They tend to look fairly rundown and poorly maintained. Some are made of concrete prefab units that are stacked on top of each other. These apartment buildings are similar to those found in Russian cities. You can also find this style of building in the Baltic countries, but these tend to look better maintained.\n- Single-family homes are very common in **suburbs and small towns**. These neighbourhoods are often heavily vegetated and tend to look rundown. Most roads are unpaved. Buildings are usually made of bricks, often have corrugated roofs, and are invariably surrounded by fences.\n- This is the **stereotypical rural round** in Ukraine: - Generally bad road quality. - A landscape that is usually flat or slightly hilly. - A line of trees or bushes next to the road, with wide open agricultural fields beyond that. - A lack of road infrastructure or buildings, until you reach the next urban area. - Low amount of traffic.\n- Almost all Ukrainian coverage was made in the **summer**, meaning the foliage is green and the people around are dressed for sunny weather. Five major cities have **autumn** coverage, with distinct fall colours and colder weather. See the region guessing section for more information.\n- These **tall poplar trees** are common in many parts of the country. NOTE: They can be found in some regions of Russia, but most of the country completely lacks them.\n- Coverage in Ukraine is mostly limited to urban areas and the main roads between them. See the region-guessing section for a map. However, one type of coverage that can sometimes trick people are **ultra-rural tracks** close to cities. This is a decently common type of coverage in Ukraine, despite the general rule that most coverage is either urban or on a main road."

                "description": "- This is a map of **street view coverage** in Ukraine. Most coverage between cities is on yellow roads. Notably, there is almost no coverage in the southeast. The only exception is Donetsk. There is also no coverage south of Odesa in the area near Romania. You can view the extent of official coverage on this site.\n- Ukrainian landline phone numbers start with a two-digit **area code**. Each oblast has its own area code. If the third digit is a 2, it refers to a phone number in the oblast’s capital (typically the biggest city). Mobile phone numbers start with 50, 63, 66-68, 73 or 91-99. They are not unique to a geographic area.\n- The first two letters on Ukrainian licence plates determine in which oblast the vehicle is registered in, making unblurred licence plates very useful for regionguessing. Unlike most regional plates in Europe, they’re not intuitive, so learning the codes beforehand is essential for utilising them. NOTE: The map shown only applies to the most recent and common plates, with a blue and yellow strip. The older plates use a regional number code, similar to Russia.\n- Oblast-specific **second-level internet domains** can occasionally be found in Ukraine. Seen in the image is the domain for Ternopil Oblast (.te.ua). They can typically be used without being memorised, as they’re mostly intuitive. You can however learn them here.\n- Five major cities were covered in 2011, years before the rest of the country was covered: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odesa and Donetsk. This coverage was made during autumn, meaning that the trees have distinct **fall colours** and people are dressed for colder weather. In Kyiv, Lviv and Kharkiv, almost all of this coverage has been overwritten by the newer summer coverage. However, in all of Donetsk, and most of Odesa, it is still intact. In Donetsk specifically, there is no newer coverage at all.\n- This older 2011 coverage was made with a **black or white Google car**, instead of the standard red one. Both cars have a long antenna. The black car was used in Donetsk. Note that Donetsk has no newer coverage whatsoever, so never guess in that city if you see a red car. The white car was used in Lviv, Kyiv and Kharkiv. As the coverage in these cities is mostly overwritten, the white car is very rare.\n- The Carpathian Mountains is an area in western Ukraine that is significantly **hillier** than the rest of the country, in some places bordering on mountainous. It is also much more forested, with very little agriculture, and a lot of pine trees. The roads going through it tend to be more curvy, rather than the straight highways found in the rest of the country.\n- Forests with **Baltic pines** (Pinus sylvestris) are most commonly found in the north, most often near the border with Belarus. Baltic pines are usually tall and have orange-red bark. While some of these forests consist solely of this species, many of them are a mix of Baltic pines and broadleaf trees. NOTE: Note that the Carpathians are also covered in a lot of pine forests. They are noticeably hilly however, allowing you to distinguish this area from the very flat north.\n- Towards the south, the climate becomes **warmer and drier**. The landscape is more arid. Forests are considerably more rare, and make way for shrubs and open fields. The difference is not extreme, but can become noticeable after some practice.\n- Sunflowers are grown in most of Ukraine. However, they only start to bloom as early as late July. Due to the way Ukraine was covered, this means you will usually only see **sunflower fields that are in bloom** in the far south and east of the country. These fields are most common in Kherson, Mykolaiv and Odesa Oblast. The road T0403 to Nova Kakhovka especially has a lot of them. Note that sunflower fields that are not in bloom can be found in most of the country. These will just look like regular crop fields to most people.\n- The **Russian language** can be found in Ukraine, particularly in the east and south. While there are several differences between Russian and Ukrainian, these are some of the most noteworthy: - The letters Ы ы, Э э are only found in Russian. - The Russian word for street is улица, abbreviated ул. - The Russian word for city is город, abbreviated г."

It can also be seen from Brody to Pochaiv on the P26 and from Dubno to Mlyniv on the E85.\n- The older 2011 coverage in Odesa was made using a silver car with a **short antenna**, rather than a black or white car with a long antenna. The car may sometimes be fully blurred.\n- **Red soil** can be seen on some ultra-rural dirt tracks around the iron mine in Kryvyi Rih, due to mining activity. Brazilian-style poles can also be seen, making locations around the mine very convincing bait. The foliage, however, will be significantly less tropical, and a long antenna can be seen.\n- These poles, with a **red band** across them, are unique to Kryvyi Rih.\n- Bus stop shelters with a vibrant **yellow-and-green** paint scheme, featuring sunflowers and the name of a local brand (Оліс), can be found in the Mykolaiv and Kherson oblasts.\n- Within Ukraine, this **visual glitch** is unique to the city of Ivano-Frankivsk.\n- These **“Polish” bollards** can be found in the Zakarpattia Oblast. They have a red reflector that wraps around the bollard. They are identical to the standard bollard used in Poland (hence the name).\n- The area near the border with Hungary is majority Hungarian. As a result, you will see a lot of signs with **Hungarian language** on it – bilingual or even monolingual.\n- In addition, the villages in this region look similar to **Hungarian architecture**. Settlements are fairly linear and organised, with predominantly single-storey houses that are closer to the street. Many roofs have orange tiles or diamond-shaped slate tiles that are similar to roofs found in central European countries like Hungary, Czechia and Slovakia.\n- Google sent a special car trekker to the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, where the nuclear disaster happened in the 1980s. This car goes from Ivankiv all the way to the **abandoned town** of Pripyat. On most of the road to Pripyat, you will not really be able to tell that you are inside the Exclusion Zone. However, inside Pripyat you will see completely abandoned and overgrown buildings, giving the place an eerie look.\n- On one side of the road going to Chernobyl, a **yellow flag with an Opel logo** can be seen on the Google car’s antenna."

NOTE: Other Middle Eastern countries, like Jordan, Israel and Oman, also use these lines.\n- In almost all Generation 3 coverage, a **white car** with visible black roof racks was used. NOTE: The UAE is the only Middle Eastern country where a white Google car can be found.\n- In Generation 4 coverage, a white **pickup truck** with a trekker camera was used for much of the coverage. In a lot of the coverage, the truck is completely blurred out. NOTE: A similar truck can be found in Qatar and Oman. In the UAE the antenna at the front of the cabin is on the middle of the car, while in Qatar it is on the left.\n- You can also find regular Generation 4 coverage taken with a **black **car. The brake light is commonly visible. NOTE: A similar Generation 4 black car can be found in Israel.\n- The official language in the UAE is Arabic. Its script can be identified by its **lines and dots**. NOTE: Due to high tourism, signs in the UAE often have English writing alongside Arabic. While this is also common in Qatar and Oman, it is not common in Jordan.\n- Houses in residential areas are typically made of **light-coloured stone**. Reddish stones are often used for sidewalks.\n- Many signposts in the UAE have **black-and-white stripes**. NOTE: Within the Middle East, striped signposts are also found in Oman.\n- Similarly, almost all curbs are **striped**. They can be either black-and-white, or black-and-yellow.\n- **Divided roads** and **roundabouts** are both very commonly seen in the UAE.\n- Electricity poles in the UAE are mostly made of **dark brown wood**. The pole tops consist of **three insulators**, symmetrically attached to a **horizontal metal bar**. NOTE: Similar poletops can be found in Oman. Jordanian poletops may look similar, but they are usually made of grey concrete, and the insulators are more spaced out.\n- Although the UAE is a wealthy country, it is not uncommon for residential roads to be **unpaved**.\n- **Rifts** can occasionally be found in the UAE.

Additionally, you might see a plate with a **green **‘Zero Emissions’ strip. NOTE: Ireland uses white front and back plates, always with a blue strip on the left.\n- The UK drives on the **left side** of the road. NOTE: The UK, Ireland, Malta and Cyprus are the only European countries that drive on the left.\n- **Double yellow road lines** are often found on the sides of marked roads, especially in urban areas. These lines indicate a no stopping zone. NOTE: These lines can also be found in Ireland.\n- These middle lines, that consist of** long dashes **with** cat’s eyes **(reflectors) in the gaps between the dashes, are a good clue for the UK.\n- The most common **bollard** in the UK looks like this. It has a rounded shape, with a red reflector on the front and a white one on the back. The base and top are black, with a white stripe in the middle.\n- The UK uses **wooden** poles. Pole steps bolted on the side of the pole are very common. These pole steps are shaped like a series of thin horizontal metal rods. NOTE: Ireland also commonly uses wooden poles with pole steps.\n- Chevrons are **black with white arrows**. NOTE: Irish chevrons are black with yellow arrows. French chevrons are blue with white arrows.\n- Like most European countries, the UK uses **triangular warning signs** with a red border and a white background. NOTE: This is mostly useful to distinguish between the UK and Ireland, as Ireland uses diamond-shaped yellow warning signs (being the only European country to do so).\n- Direction signs in the United Kingdom can be **blue, green, or white.** Look for the letters **A** or **M**, as these are the major roads in the country. Smaller roads start with **B**. NOTE: Irish direction signs are typically bilingual, with Irish names in italics, making them easy to distinguish from the UK ones.\n- The UK commonly uses these **white street signs** with black text, that are positioned low to the ground. They are usually supported by two small posts. Many street signs in suburban areas will have a small cul-de-sac icon. They can sometimes have different colours or feature small designs, like coats of arms.\n- UK yield signs feature the phrase “**GIVE WAY**”. NOTE: Irish yields signs just have the word “YIELD”.\n- The **yellow warning stickers** on utility poles can be a good way to distinguish between the UK and Ireland. The most important difference is that UK stickers feature a guy getting zapped by a lightning bolt. The Irish stickers usually have a lightning bolt, but lack the guy getting zapped. They also often have an extra second rectangular sticker with a black outline, below the lightning bolt.\n- This **yellow traffic bollard** is commonly found in the UK.\n- Pedestrian crossing signs are almost non-existent in the UK. Instead, pedestrian crossings will often have these distinctive **black and white striped poles**, with a yellow light bulb on top. NOTE: These signposts are also common in Ireland.\n- Rural metal gates with **square corners** are very common in the UK. NOTE: This is mainly useful to distinguish it from Ireland, where similar gates typically have rounded corners. Gates in Northern Ireland also typically have rounded corners.\n- The British countryside tends to be very green, with lots of **hedgerows **lining the road. Low, rolling hills are common throughout most of the country. NOTE: The Irish countryside looks very similar, so make sure to look at other clues before guessing.\n- **Terraced houses** (row houses) are very common in the UK. This housing type shares walls on both sides with neighbouring homes. You will also see a lot of semi-detached houses, which share just one side wall with another house. NOTE: 61% of the population lives in terraced or semi-detached houses, significantly more than most other European countries. The only European countries where terraced houses are this common are Ireland and the Netherlands.\n- **Red brick buildings **are common in many parts of the UK. NOTE: Red brick architecture is also common in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark, as well as parts of northern France.\n- **Suburbs** in UK towns tend to have a recognizable look. They typically feature near-identical houses, often semi-detached, usually with well-manicured lawns. The road layout can be maze-like, with lots of cul-de-sacs and curvy roads.\n- Many British buildings have distinct-looking chimneys with multiple so-called **chimney pots**. These pots are usually round and brick-coloured.\n- Some buildings, both old and new, feature black-and-white **timber framing**. NOTE: This is less common in Ireland.\n- The UK has Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot."

Motorways also generally follow this pattern. Beware that roads starting with any digit from 1 to 8 can also be found in Northern Ireland.\n- **Landline phone numbers** in the UK always have nine or ten digits after the 0 trunk code. The first two to four digits after the 0 are the area code. Unfortunately for Geoguessr players, there is not much rhyme or reason to their geographic ordering. However, the area codes of some large cities are still worth memorising. The most important ones are summarised in this infographic. Notably, all of Northern Ireland uses the phone code 028, and all of London uses 020. A complete overview of all other area codes is available in this infographic.\n- Bins in urban areas often have the **city name** on them.\n- The Scottish Highlands can be distinguished by the semi-barren, very **mountainous** landscape. NOTE: A lot of Generation 4 coverage in the Highlands is from (early) spring, meaning that the vegetation often looks brown and yellow. In addition, some of the most mountainous parts of Wales and Northern England can look similar.\n- In Scotland, you can often find these **red and white bollards**. They are round, bulky, and have a red-and-grey reflector that wraps all the way around. They are sometimes found in other parts of the UK. NOTE: The bollard looks similar to the French one. However, there are some small differences. For example, the Scottish bollard is round on the top, while the French one is more spiked.\n- These** diamond-shaped** **‘Passing Place’ **signs are most commonly found in Scotland.\n- **Welsh** is a Celtic language that is spoken throughout Wales. Road signs in Wales are usually bilingual English and Welsh. Towns often have Welsh names too. Welsh uses the letters **D**, **W**, and **Y** much more commonly than English. The double **LL** is also very distinct. NOTE: Scottish Gaelic and Irish are both also Celtic languages. They can look somewhat similar to Welsh.\n- In Wales, markings on the road are in both English and Welsh. One of the best examples of this is ‘**Araf**’, which means ‘Slow’. This marking is only found in Wales. NOTE: Araf is not the only Welsh language marking you can find, it is just the most common. Whenever you see an obviously non-English marking next to an English one, consider guessing in Wales.\n- **Scottish Gaelic** is a Celtic language that is closely related to Irish. They have a very similar look and use accent marks commonly. Common and recognizable letter clusters include bh, dh, fh, mh, ai, ea, eo, and ui. Scottish Gaelic on road signs is found most commonly in the Scottish Highlands, and is almost always found north of Glasgow. NOTE: Scottish Gaelic on road signs will often be in green or yellow text. This will not happen with Welsh or Irish on road signs.\n- It is common to see houses made of **large blocks of sandstone or granite **in Scotland. Granite buildings are common in Aberdeen, red sandstone is common in Glasgow and Dumfries, and yellow sandstone is common in Edinburgh.\n- Cornish palms (Cordyline australis) in the UK are most commonly found in the far **southwest** along the coast and in Jersey.

For example, speed and distance are measured in **miles**. You will also often see feet and inches on signs, indicating the height of bridges. NOTE: This is useful to distinguish between the English-speaking parts of Canada, where British English spelling and (usually) the metric system are used. For example, Canada measures speed in kilometres.\n- **Generation 2** coverage is **rare** in the US. If you have a Generation 2 location in a North American setting, you are more likely to be in Canada. The exception to this is Alaska, and to a lesser extent Hawaii, which have a fair amount of Generation 2. You can also rarely see generation 2 in rural areas of the deep south. **Generation 3** coverage is also significantly less common than in Canada.\n- Road signs in the US tend to use **more words** compared to their Canadian counterparts. A good example are railway crossing signs, which feature the literal words ‘railway crossing’ on them. In Canada, these signs are typically blank. This tendency is also noticeable on yellow diamond warning signs. In Canada, the words will usually be on a rectangular sign below the yellow diamond, which would have a diagram on it instead.\n- The US uses the phrase ‘**Speed Limit**’ on their speed signs. The numbers on American speed signs are usually lower than that of Canada’s, since they use miles instead of kilometres. In addition, speed limits ending in 5 are more common in the US. NOTE: Canada uses the word ‘Maximum’ on their speed signs.\n- **Triangular yellow signs** with the phrase ‘No Passing Zone’ are exclusive to the US.\n- American **yield signs** are shaped like an upside down triangle with a red border, with a white field with the word ‘YIELD’. NOTE: Canadian yield signs look similar, but lack the ‘YIELD’ text.\n- American one-way signs are usually a **horizontal black rectangle** with a **white arrow** inside of it. These signs will also always have the words ‘ONE WAY’ printed on them. In cities, they are a white vertical rectangle with the words ‘ONE WAY’ on them and an arrow underneath. NOTE: Canadian one-way signs are of the same shape and colour, but might not have the words ‘ONE WAY’ on them.\n- **Parking indicator signs** in the US are typically white metal signs with red, green, or black text. They may include specific information about when you can park on said road, and arrows indicating where parking is (or is not) allowed. NOTE: Canadian parking signs use similar styles and colours, but typically are less ‘wordy,’ instead using more symbols when applicable.\n- Large highways in the US use large, rectangular, **green metal signs** with curved edges and white text to mark highway exits, distances to nearby towns, and the names of upcoming roads (mainly in cities). NOTE: Canadian highway signs have a similar appearance, but will typically have squared edges, instead of curved edges.\n- Leading up to exits on large highways you commonly see large, **blue rectangular signs** with white text, highlighting services, such as food, lodging and petrol, that are available at the upcoming highway exit. NOTE: Canada uses similar signs on some of their highways.\n- These rectangular **junction signs** with a single or double arrow are found in the US. NOTE: Canada uses diamond-shaped junction signs.\n- White and orange **fibre optic cable markers** are almost unique to the US. NOTE: On very rare occasions, they can be found in Canada.\n- This is an example of the most common type of **orange construction barrel** in the United States. They are made out of orange plastic with horizontal white stripes and a black rubber base. They are usually used to block off lanes to traffic during times of road construction.\n- The US uses **yellow middle lines** and white outer lines. Double middle lines are the most common. On divided roads, the outer line closest to the median will be yellow, and the other lines will usually be white. NOTE: Double middle lines are less common in Canada, but not rare – use this meta with caution. Furthermore, yellow road lines are very rare in Europe.\n- Interstate highways, US highways, and some state roads have **rumble strips** in each edge of the road; which are small indentations in the pavement perpendicular to the road. These can be located on the outside edges of the road and in between lanes on multi-lane highways. NOTE: Rumble strips may appear in Canada, but are much more rare.\n- **Small, rectangular manufactured homes**, also known as mobile or ‘trailer’ homes, are popular in rural areas of the US. In general, mobile homes are more common in the Southeast but they can be seen anywhere in the country. NOTE: This style of home can sometimes be seen in Canada, but to a much lesser extent.\n- **Baptist churches** are very common in the United States. Similar to mobile homes, these are more common in the Southern Plains and Southeast United States, but can be found in all 50 states. NOTE: Baptist churches are rare in Canada.\n- Pictured here is a group of **gas stations** and **convenience store** chains that operate **in the United States**, but **not in Canada**. This is not a comprehensive list, but some of the most common American-only chains. Regional gas station chains are found near the end of the ‘Step 2’ section of this guide. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Pictured here is a group of **restaurant chains** that operate **in the United States**, but **not in Canada** (Chick Fil A is the only exception with a few locations in the Toronto area.) This is not a comprehensive list, but some of the most common American-only chains. Regional restaurant chains are found at the end of the ‘Step 2’ section of this guide. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- In addition to having less Generation 3 coverage than Canada, the side mirrors are also blurred out differently: While they generally appear as two peaks in Canadian Gen 3 coverage, you will mostly see a **single peak** in the US.\n- In the US and Canada, especially at large intersections, **long metal bars** with **stop lights** attached to them hang over the street. These bars also commonly have street signs, highway signs, or other signs attached to them.\n- Thin metal sign posts are common. They will typically either have several small holes or have a U-profile.\n- North America primarily uses **wooden utility poles**. Several European countries also primarily use wooden utility poles. However, a concrete pole in particular is mostly associated with Europe.\n- This style of **insulator**, that is raised slightly **on top** of the utility pole, can be a good clue for the US and Canada. It is not typically found in Europe. It is especially apparent on simple poles with a single insulator.\n- This style of **mailbox**, resting on top of a post and with a small flag on the side, is mostly associated with North America.\n- North American semi-trucks have a **longer nose**, since the engine is in front of the driver’s cab. In contrast, European and Asian semi-trucks are cabovers, meaning the driver sits on top of the engine, giving the truck an **L shape**. NOTE: This is only useful to differentiate between North America and Europe, as these trucks are found throughout all of the Americas. Australian and New Zealand trucks are typically a mix of the two.\n- Here are two common types of **water towers** seen in towns across the United States and Canada. They are typically very tall, and sometimes have the name of the town and state painted on them, so they can be useful for region guessing.\n- **Generation 3** coverage in the US and Canada generally has **no visible antenna**. This can be helpful to distinguish it from Europe in low-info rounds. Some European Generation 3 coverage has no visible antenna, but most of it does. There is an important exception: in national parks in the US, you can find a Generation 3 car with a stubby antenna with diagonal coils around it. Still, this specific type of antenna is not found in Europe.\n- Both the US and Canada also have Generation 4 “smallcam” coverage, which is mounted lower than regular Generation 4 and has a relatively big circular blur with a small protrusion at the front. The blur can also be fully transparent, making it harder to spot. When the car isn’t blurred properly, you will usually see a mirror sticking out on the right side."

                "description": "- Shown here is the population density of the United States. In General, areas east of the Missouri river are more densely populated than areas to the west. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- The US, as well as most of the Americas, uses short licence plates, in contrast to longer European ones. Each US state has their own **unique licence plate** design. Some of these are recognizable through the blur, and are thus worth learning. Around half of the states also do not require front plates, which can also be useful in determining the state. _You can click on the image to enlarge it. Here you can also find a map showing the locations of each plate._\n- **Interstate Highways** are divided highways that often span large areas of the United States. Even-numbered Interstates run west to east, with the lowest numbers along the Gulf Coast and Mexico border. Odd-numbered highways run south to north, with the lowest numbers along the West Coast. **US Highways** are also typically long roads that are sometimes (but not always) divided. The numbering system is generally the inverse of Interstate Highways, with low odd-numbered highways located along the East Coast and low even-numbered highways located close to the Canadian border in the north of the country. NOTE: There are generally more exceptions to the US Highway numbering system than the Interstate Highway numbering system, in terms of placement. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- US telephone numbers start with a three-digit **area code**. While these area codes are not clustered by initial digits, they are useful to learn. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Each of the 50 states has its own **state flag**. These appear frequently enough that they are worth learning. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- Shown here is a **topographic map** of the US. Most significant elevation is in the west: here you will find large mountain ranges, but also more flat, high plateaus. Some parts have lower elevation: good examples are the Central Valley) and Imperial Valley in California. Elevation in the east is generally much lower. The most significant amount of elevation is found in the Appalachians, low mountain ranges running through the eastern and northeastern US. Good examples of hills in otherwise fairly flat regions are the Driftless Area in the Midwest, and The Ozarks in Missouri and Arkansas. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- This is a **forest density map** of the contiguous United States. Eastern and Northern regions of the country typically have much denser tree cover than Western and Southwestern regions. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Corn fields** can most commonly be found in these regions. For a detailed overview, see this map.\n- **Soybeans** are short, dark green crops organised in long rows and are found in similar regions where corn is grown. They are most common in the Eastern Plains, Midwest, Lower Mississippi Valley, and areas of the Mid Atlantic.\n- Along the Canadian border in North Dakota, and rarely Montana, fields filled with **short yellow canola flowers** (Brassica napus) can commonly be seen from the road.\n- **Cotton** is a crop that produces large fields of **fluffy white flowers**. It is most commonly produced in coastal Southeast States, the Lower Mississippi River Valley, Western Texas, and parts of California and Arizona. You can click here for a more detailed map. NOTE: When cotton is not fully grown (earlier in the year) cotton fields often look like this.\n- **Rice** production only occurs in a few areas of the US, so it is very useful for region guessing. It is typically grown in large, flat fields that resemble low prairies. It is only grown in north-central California and the Lower Mississippi River Valley in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi. You can click here for a more detailed map. NOTE: When rice is not fully grown, rice fields often look similar to this.\n- **Oil pumpjacks** are short, industrial-looking metal structures located at the surface of oil fields and are used to pump crude oil from the earth below. They are most common in western states, particularly in Texas, Eastern New Mexico, and North Dakota.\n- The Great Plains are in the middle of the United States and stretch from the Canadian border in the North, to central Texas in the South. This area is primarily **flat with few trees**. Some areas feature agriculture fields, while others feature dry and barren grassy fields.\n- The area spanning from the Montana Border with Saskatchewan to the Western Great Lakes features many ‘prairie potholes.’ These are areas of low-lying wetlands that feature **marshy grasses** and **small, shallow ponds**.\n- The Appalachian mountain range is a low mountain range that runs through the eastern states. The general landscape consists of **low, forested mountains**, with beech and oak trees being a common sight. NOTE: Houses in the south generally have less storeys. New England architecture, commonly consisting of wood panelling, high roofs and a porch, is also more common toward the north, especially in New England.\n- The loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), commonly referred to as **southern pines** in the community, are found throughout the southeastern US. They are a great way to recognize this region, as they are abundant, recognizable and mostly limited to this part of the country. They tend to be tall, with fluffy-looking clusters of pine needles.\n- Many parts of the Deep South, stretching from Oklahoma to South Carolina, have **reddish soil**. The exact tint of the soil can range from yellow to deep red.\n- Grass that is used in lawns in the southern US (colloquially known as Bermuda and St. Augustine grasses) go dormant in the winter months. This causes the lawns to turn **beige or light brown in winter**; whereas grasses used in more northern areas of the US stay much greener in winter.\n- The Lower Mississippi River Valley is a **very flat** and open landscape with **red soil** in areas of Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Northeast Louisiana. Corn and other crops are common in this area.\n- The area stretching from the Canadian border to Northern New Mexico is home to the Rocky Mountains. These jagged, rocky formations often feature many **pine trees** and **visible snow** all-year round at the highest peaks. Some areas of the Rocky Mountain Range are noticeably dry, with few trees.\n- The Great Basin, centred around Nevada, can be recognized by the tall, sometimes snow-capped mountains in the background. There are dry, but grassy, and slightly **shrubby plains** leading up to the mountains. The tallest mountains are in Nevada, Utah and California. More gradual, rocky hills can be seen in Oregon, and greener mountains can be seen in Idaho and central Utah. Keep in mind that there are exceptions, so make sure to look out for other clues before guessing.\n- Great Basin Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) is a **short, shrubby blue-green bush** that is common in the interior western United States.It is most common in arid areas.\n- Saguaro cacti are most commonly shaped like** tall, straight tubes **with **several branches **extending from the main tube. They are most commonly found in southern Arizona, on the Sonoran border.\n- Extremely **tall conifer trees** (Douglas firs) with a dark brown bark, and dark green leaves, can most commonly be seen in Cascadia. Notably, they can also be found in northern California, Idaho and as far east as Montana. Beware that they are also commonly found in British Columbia.\n- Temperate rainforests are found in coastal areas of Washington, Oregon, and Northern California. These rainforests feature many **broadleaf trees, large conifers, and ferns.** NOTE: These rainforests stretch north into coastal British Columbia and Southeast Alaska as well.\n- The Southwest, centred around the Four Corners region of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, feature many **mesas** and **tablelands**. Often, these rock formations will be **red** in colour. Additionally, red soil is common in these areas.\n- **Palm trees** are common in coastal areas of the Southeastern states, as well as the Desert Southwest region. Shown here is the Mexican Fan Palm, which is most common in California and along the Gulf Coast, but other palm tree types have a similar range.\n- Just west of the metropolitan areas of Austin and San Antonio Texas lies a large area of dry, rocky hills featuring many **yucca** and **prickly pear** plants. Texas Live Oak trees are the predominant tree type in this area.\n- The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas is **extremely flat** and features **shrubby trees** and agricultural fields. This area borders the Mexican state of Tamaulipas.\n- Spanish moss, appearing as **greyish white drapes**, can sometimes be seen on trees in the deep south.\n- **Agricultural golden fields** can commonly be seen in eastern Washington. NOTE: Flat areas of northern and eastern Oregon can have a similar appearance.\n- Central Valley, California can be recognized by its **Mediterranean climate**. This is reflected in its agriculture, seen in the vineyards and olive trees that can commonly be found here. In addition, rolling hills can be seen toward the edges of the valley.\n- The **Nebraska Sandhills** are a recognizable region of rolling hills covered with prairie grass in the central-north part of the state.\n- In the Appalachian area stretching from southern New York to southern Virginia, there are a lot of forest-covered rolling hills, with **flat valleys** dividing them. A majority of the ridges are oriented Southwest to Northeast.\n- **The** **Ouachita Mountains** stretch from Eastern Oklahoma into West-Central Arkansas. Unlike the nearby Ozark Mountains, these mountains are typically more steep in nature and easier to see from a distance.\n- Maximum speed limits vary by state and territory. The **maximum speed limits** shown here will generally be seen on interstate highways. Some interstates and highways in their respective states or territories will have lower maximum speed limits than what is shown. You can click on the image to enlarge it. Here is a map of the maximum speed limits on US territories.\n- Each state has their own highway shield. Some states have their own **unique, recognizable** highway shields that can be seen here.\n- Most states have unique, distinct and learnable Adopt-a-Highway signs, which can be seen on the side of roads. A map of those can be seen here. Keep in mind, some states have slight variations in design. _You can click on the image to enlarge it._\n- **Blue and yellow** shields are used for county roads, and can be seen in certain states in the US. Keep in mind, unique designs can be found in some counties in certain states. For more information, see here.\n- These **rectangular raised pavement markers** are found in the south and west of the US and also in Massachusetts.\n- **Snowplowable raised pavement markers** can only be found on highways in the eastern states shown in the image. They are built into the road and somewhat resemble the letter H.\n- Some roads and highways in the state of Kentucky use uniquely-shaped rumble strips that are **thin, relatively long recessed lines** on the very outside edges of the road.\n- Guardrails, signs, and signposts are commonly painted a **medium brown colour** in US National Parks, which are often located in the west. Guardrails that are painted brown can be made out of both wood and metal. Rock walls can also sometimes be seen in place of guardrails. Here you can find a map showing where all US National Parks are located. NOTE: There are occasional exceptions to this rule, so consider other clues before guessing in a National Park.\n- Wisconsin and Missouri are the only two states that use a **lettering system** (A - ZZZ) for their county highways. Wisconsin signs typically have the word ‘county’ above the letter, while Missouri signs typically do not. The borders of the signs also vary slightly.\n- **Concrete paving** on main highways is much more common in Iowa than in other states. NOTE: Concrete paving on residential streets is commonly seen throughout the Midwest states and parts of the East Coast.\n- Yellow lines with a noticeably **larger gap** in between them are most common in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oregon. They can also be found to a lesser extent in Washington, Alabama, and Michigan. NOTE: Wide middle lines can also rarely appear in other states, so consider other clues before guessing.\n- Some roads in West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland use middle yellow lines that are thicker than traditional yellow road lines. NOTE: These are not present on all roads in these states, and can be found elsewhere, so use this tip in conjunction with other clues.\n- Speed signs in Oregon often simply have the word ‘**Speed**’ instead of the standard ‘Speed Limit’.\n- A **black stripe** can sometimes be seen in between the two yellow, middle road lines in California.\n- Utility poles in California usually have markings at the bottom of the pole that consist of **3 yellow stripes**.\n- Some small roads in California **lack a middle yellow line**; instead only feature solid white lines on each side of the road. NOTE: This can rarely be seen in other states.\n- This bollard is found in **Nevada**. It consists of a reflector on a thin stick. The reflector is a vertical rectangle that consists of a white field surrounded by a black outline.\n- The most common type of roadside bollard in South Dakota and Montana features a **dark metal post **with a **white diamond** on each side of the top. NOTE: These bollards can be found to a lesser extent in other western states.\n- Roadside bollards in Wyoming often feature a dark metal pole with a white circular reflector at the top. The **top** of the metal pole is sometimes painted **white or grey**, which is unique to Wyoming.\n- The state of Washington uses bollards that consist of a white or brown post with a white rectangle on the front of the bollard, and** two smaller white or silver squares **on the back of the bollard.\n- Streets in Utah and Idaho, particularly in urban areas, are often named by using a combination of a **number and cardinal direction** (i.e. ‘600 South.’) NOTE: This style of street naming can be found rarely in other Western states.\n- **Texan roads** often have a grainy, ‘salt and pepper’-like road surface. NOTE: Similar pavement can sometimes be seen in adjacent states such as New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Colorado.\n- Some rural roads in the Upper Midwest use a similar road pavement to Texas. They will have a **grainy, ‘salt and pepper’-like road surface**, but will vary in colour. These roads are most common in the state of Illinois.\n- **Yellow** or **red** bands can commonly be seen around signposts in Texas. NOTE: Similar reflectors can sometimes be seen in other states, such as Hawaii.\n- These **white reflectors** on signposts are unique to Kansas. They are most commonly seen on ‘stop’ signs in rural areas.\n- In Minnesota, these yellow signs with **vertical, black triangles** are placed before bridges at most major river crossings and at the beginnings and ends of guardrail sections on large highways.\n- On most rural ‘stop’ signposts in Minnesota, a **black-and-white** **marker** is attached to the posts horizontally. The shape may vary slightly.\n- These green **ATV Route signs** are unique to Wisconsin.\n- A rectangular **white** metal plate, with an orange rectangle and diamond, can be seen on most poles in Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n- These simple **white** bollards with **black reflectors** are unique to Wisconsin.\n- A horizontal blue, red, or green sign can commonly be seen at the ends of driveways in Wisconsin and the Michigan peninsula. The house number is present, in addition to either the **town name** and or the **road name** (usually.) NOTE: Nearby states often use similar markers, but typically lack any town or street name information and only feature numbers.\n- Signs attached to **two signposts** can be seen in Michigan. Not all signs are attached to two signposts. NOTE: Double signposts can also be seen in other states, but are not as common.\n- Many large intersections in Michigan have stop lights and signs that **hang from wires** that stretch across the middle of the intersection. These markers are commonly in yellow boxes. NOTE: These are not completely unique to Michigan, but are most commonly seen there.\n- Properties in rural and exurban Ohio, Lower Michigan, and Indiana commonly feature a **vertically-oriented metal sign** with white numbers, indicating the house number of the adjacent building. These signs are most commonly blue or green, and are commonly attached to mailboxes. NOTE: These may be rarely found in other states.\n- West Virginia sometimes features street signs with a symbol that resembles a **fraction** inside a **circle**.\n- North Carolina commonly uses a style of street signs showing **street numbers** and **arrows** in addition to the street name. NOTE: Other states occasionally feature street signs with similar designs, so use other clues before guessing.\n- In Oklahoma, you can often find a green rectangular sign with **3 rows of numbers** attached to the back of stop signs at rural intersections.\n- Rectangular **white** signs can sometimes be seen attached to signposts at intersections in Pennsylvania. On top, the number of the converging state route is written.\n- Rectangular **white** signs can sometimes be seen at intersections in Virginia.\n- **White signs** attached to signposts can commonly be seen in North Carolina.\n- **Black** street signs with white text can commonly be found at intersections in South Carolina.\n- **Square guardrails** are the most dominant (but not the only) type of guardrail in the states of New York and Wyoming. They have a long bar across the top, with several square legs supporting them. NOTE: These guardrails can be found, to a lesser extent, in some adjacent states.\n- In New Hampshire there will often be a **white metal sign** with the characters ‘**E-2**’ on it adjacent to the road, typically at either end of bridges.\n- Vermont features **small rectangular green signs** on stop sign posts with three rows of horizontal numbers. The top row of numbers correlates to the highway or road number that the road with the stop sign intersects with. For example, this image is taken from Vermont State Road 116, looking towards the intersecting road. The State of New York uses similar style signs. However, these signs can be attached to different types of sign posts (town entry signs, highway signs, etc.)\n- Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts use **small green and red rectangular signs** to mark the ends of bridges and guardrails. NOTE: Not all bridges and guardrails in these states will have these markers.\n- In rural areas of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, **short rock walls** are commonly visible adjacent to the road. NOTE: These rock walls can be found rarely in adjacent states.\n- **Dark-coloured wooden fences** with several horizontal wooden supports are common in farming areas of central and southern Appalachia, stretching from Pennsylvania to Georgia. NOTE: These types of fences can be found elsewhere to a lesser extent, so use other clues before guessing.\n- **Stilt houses** can sometimes be seen on the coast. These are especially common toward the south, and on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.\n- Similar in style to aforementioned stilt houses, houses with much shorter stilts are common in the western and central Gulf Coast. These houses typically feature short stilts made of concrete or wood (**1-3 feet off the ground**) and are primarily found in areas near the coast and any adjacent rivers.\n- Buildings with very **large, sloped roofs** are most common in the states of Oklahoma, Texas, and Louisiana. They can also be seen in neighbouring states to a lesser extent.\n- Houses in coastal New England often feature **shingle walls**, which are layered wood panels overlapping each other. A similar style of panelling can also be seen, however, having a wider range than the one shown above.\n- Older **three story wooden houses**, also called ‘stacked triplexes),’ are very common in urban areas of the Northeast. They are most prevalent in New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. NOTE: These types of houses are also somewhat common in cities in Atlantic Canada.\n- Brownstone buildings are typically row houses or government buildings made out of various types of **brick** and **sandstone**. They are most commonly found in dense urban areas of the Northeast US, as well as Chicago.\n- Buildings with **red metal rooftops** are most commonly found in the Mid-South and Southern Appalachia states of Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and North Carolina. NOTE: These types of rooftops can be found in other areas, so use other clues before guessing.\n- **Very narrow, one-storey** houses made out of wood are called ‘shotgun houses.’ They are most common in and around New Orleans (LA,) Houston (TX,) Louisville (KY,) and the state of Mississippi.\n- Pueblo Revival style houses are commonly seen in New Mexico. They are typically constructed of adobe or brick and concrete. They have **rounded edges** and **flat roofs**, and are usually sand-brown in colour. NOTE: Pueblo style houses can also be seen in Arizona and Colorado to a lesser extent.\n- Spanish Colonial Revival Architecture can be categorised as buildings with **lightly-coloured stucco walls** and **red clay-tile roofs**. They can be found in the desert southwest states of California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas. You can also find similar types of buildings in Florida and coastal Georgia.\n- Houses and commercial buildings in the interior Western US are often made of lots of **dark wooden boards and timbers**. Buildings at high elevations also commonly have metal roofs, to avoid snow build-up.\n- ‘**Shoprite**’ is a regional supermarket chain that has locations in 6 states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic region of the US; Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland.\n- ‘**Hy-Vee**’ is a supermarket that is common primarily in the Upper Midwest states of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois.\n- The supermarket chain ‘**Piggly** Wiggly’ is found mostly in the Southeast, as well as the state of Wisconsin.\n- ‘**H-E-B**’ is a supermarket that is only located in the state of Texas. Most H-E-B stores are in large cities.\n- ‘**Publix**’ is a regional supermarket chain that has locations primarily in Florida and adjacent areas of the Deep South.\n- The restaurant chain ‘**Waffle House**’ is a regional chain that is primarily found in the Southern and Southeast US. Some midwest and mid-atlantic states have some locations. Georgia, by far, is the state with the most Waffle House locations.\n- ‘**Carl’s Jr.**’ and ‘**Hardee’s**’ are fast food restaurants that are operated by the same company and have a similar logo and colour scheme. However, Carl’s Jr. locations are all located on the West Coast and Southwest US, while Hardee’s are found in the central and Eastern areas of the country. Two states, Wyoming and Oklahoma, have both kinds of restaurants present.\n- ‘**Zaxby’s**,’ a fast-food chicken chain, is another restaurant that is most common in the Southeast US. There are several pockets outside the Southeast that have locations, such as Utah and Montana. Like Waffle House, Georgia has the highest number of locations.\n- ‘**Whataburger**’ is a hamburger restaurant with locations across the South Central US.

                "description": "- As part of a promotional campaign, the TransAmerica Trail from Oregon to North Carolina was covered by a **Ford Bronco**. The car can recognised by its unblurred black roof and red hood, and is mostly found on unpaved rural roads. Looking backwards, you will see two other Ford SUVs escorting the camera car.\n- Interstate 19 in Arizona from Tucson to the Mexico border uses **kilometres** on the exit and distance signs. This is the only part of the country that uses kilometres instead of miles for highway signs. NOTE: Speed limit signs in this area still use MPH instead of KPH.\n- Many bridges are used to connect the various neighbourhoods of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. These expansive, **steel bridges** are commonly painted **bright yellow**. Additionally, Pittsburgh is easy to identify because of it being flanked by 3 rivers and steep bluffs on all sides.\n- Row Houses and other buildings in San Francisco are often in the style of Victorian architecture, with many **bay windows, turrets, and ornate exterior details**. These homes are built close together and can be very colourful.\n- Neighbourhoods all around the city of New Orleans feature many **colourful, historic, shotgun-style houses.** Buildings in central areas of New Orleans often feature colourful facades with second story wrap-around balconies**.**\n- Historical areas of Miami and Miami beach are home to many historical, **multi-story art deco** buildings. These buildings are commonly painted in bright colours and are located near the coast.\n- The main island of Dry Tortugas National Park, west of Key West, can be identified by the **hexagonal brick structure** and the surrounding moat. The Loggerhead Lighthouse, situated on the Loggerhead Key, has a brown top-half and a white bottom. The path on which the trekker walks on is also made of bright concrete, and many palm trees can be seen around the lighthouse.\n- The Florida Keys are an archipelago of tropical islands west of Miami. The highway connecting the islands can be recognized by green, tropical vegetation on the sides of the usually single lane road. The soil is also **sandy white**. Urban locations are also similar, but with many more planted palm trees and mowed grass being a common sight.\n- Deep South Florida, between the metropolitan areas of Ft. Myers and Miami, features **dense, jungle-like forests** that have few inhabitants. Roads through these areas are commonly very straight and long.\n- The area between the cities of Orlando and Lakeland in Florida sometimes feature **low**, **rolling hills.** Lakes and agricultural fields are also common in this area. This is the only main hilly area in central or southern Florida.\n- Southwestern Oklahoma features a small area of **rocky, shrubby peaks**. Some of the mountains are also covered in trees, and the rocks can have a pinkish red tint to them.\n- Central Colorado is home to a large **North-to-South oriented mountain ridge**. This divides the Rocky Mountains to the west and the Great Plains to the east.These mountains are adjacent to the major metropolitan areas of Boulder, Denver, and Colorado Springs.\n- Big Bend National Park is located along the Mexico border in Southwest Texas. It can be identified by its **dry, rocky peaks and shrubby foliage**. This park is adjacent to the Chihauhan desert, so plants such as yucca and prickly pear cactus are common.\n- Along the New Mexico and or Texas border there is a ridge of **tall, dry peaks** known as the Guadalupe Mountains. In adjacent areas of both states, smaller foothills of these mountains can be seen with relatively flat tops and shrubby foliage.\n- Death Valley National Park can be easily recognized by the **dry, sandy, treeless mountains** that can be seen from the roads that go through the park. In Generation 3 coverage, the sky can look particularly dusty. NOTE: Many smaller roads in Death Valley only have Generation 1 coverage.\n- Along the Canadian border in Montana lies Glacier National Park. It is easily recognizable by its extremely tall and **steep mountain peaks**. Most coverage is also hazy and taken during summer. NOTE: Other National Parks within the Rocky Mountain range of the US can have a similar appearance, so consider other clues before guessing.\n- Badlands National Park features these distinct, **sand-brown**, **eroded rock formations**. The formations may sometimes appear more rounded, and lighter in colour.\n- Theodore Roosevelt National Park features similar, **sand-brown**, eroded rock formations to Badlands National Park. The rock formations in this park tend to have more trees on them. Additionally, almost all coverage has **fall colours** visible. NOTE: Similar formations can be seen in far eastern Montana as well.\n- In far Northeastern Wyoming lies Devil’s Tower, which is a **very tall, standalone butte** protruding from the surrounding land. This can sometimes be seen from many miles away because of the lack of nearby mountains.\n- The Black Hills, located in far Western South Dakota and far Eastern Wyoming, are a series of moderately tall mountains with large amounts of **conifer trees** and **rocky outcroppings**. The surrounding areas are typically much flatter with lesser tree cover. NOTE: This area has a similar appearance to many areas within the Rocky Mountains, which lie further to the West."

                "description": "- This is the stereotypical Uruguay round. The coverage often, but not always, features **overcast** weather. Most of the landscape consists of open grasslands with gentle hills. Occasionally, you might see separated tree plantations. Roads are generally in worse condition than in neighbouring countries.\n- Uruguayan **licence plates** are plain white with black characters. NOTE: Neighbouring Argentina also uses white licence plates, but they will have either a black dot in the middle or a blue bar at the top.\n- Uruguay only has Generation 3 coverage. Coverage was taken by a **black Google car** without an antenna. The car is not always visible. NOTE: Within South America, you can also find this car in Argentina and Peru.\n- In a lot of coverage, the camera quality is somewhat **smudgy**. NOTE: This is significantly less common in Argentina.\n- Uruguay uses **thick wooden signposts**, which are typically painted white. They often have up to four rectangular notches at the back of the post. NOTE: Thick wooden signposts can also be seen in Bolivia.\n- Uruguay often has these **triple road lines**, that consist of double yellow roadlines with white dashes in between. This is a design not seen anywhere else in the Americas.\n- You can also find two other, non-unique road line patterns: - Yellow-white lines (also found in Argentina) - Simple white lines (found in many other places).\n- These **white bollards**, with one side often painted yellow, and **stone barriers**, are specific to Uruguay.\n- Uruguay uses a handful of different utility poles. One very common and useful one are the so-called **trident poles**, which get their name from their distinctive pole tops with three insulators that point upwards. NOTE: Similar trident poles can be found in the neighbouring Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.\n- You can also see a variety of other pole designs, including: - Round poles with a pole top consisting of **flat metal sheets** - **Square** concrete poles. Both of these pole designs are also good clues for Uruguay. In addition, you might see simple wooden poles with one insulator, as well as very rarely some Argentina-style poles.\n- Uruguayan guardrails have a small, rectangular yellow or red reflector, which is the same as in Argentina. They can be differentiated by the shape of their support. In Argentina, the supports are made up of three sides of a rectangle. Uruguayan supports have the same three sides, and additionally parts of the fourth side at the corners.\n- This **green-painted** stone kilometre marker is unique to Uruguay.\n- Like most of Latin America, chevrons are **yellow with black arrows**. NOTE: This is mostly useful to distinguish between Argentina, which uniquely uses chevrons that are white with red arrows.\n- As mentioned before, most of Uruguay is **slightly hilly**, even though the overall elevation is fairly low. Although it is by no means a mountainous country, roads generally have at least a slight incline. Take note that this hilliness is usually very subtle: don’t expect immense rolling hills in most of the country. NOTE: If your location is completely flat, consider that you might be in Argentina instead.\n- In many parts of Uruguay, you can find **reddish soil**. The tint can range from light pink (pictured here) to deep red. NOTE: This type of reddish soil is less common in the similar-looking parts of Argentina. Hence, it can be a good clue for Uruguay when you are faced with a tough decision. However, be cautious with using this meta in the inverse way: the absence of this type of soil does not exclude Uruguay, as you can still find a lot of generic white and brown soil throughout the country.\n- Many **Uruguayan houses** are made out of concrete, and are somewhat cube-shaped. Walls often have drab colours and tend to look weathered. Flat roofs are relatively common. NOTE: Architecture in Argentina often looks similar.\n- Occasionally, you might see **palm trees**. These short and stocky species of palm tree are particularly common.\n- **Cattle farming** is an important part of Uruguay’s agriculture. Cattle outnumber people four by one, so you will see a lot of them around in rural rounds."

Outside of this area, most coverage is confined to yellow roads. This makes **angle guessing** a powerful tool to potentially get very close guesses. For a zoomable overview of official street view coverage, see this site.\n- Subtle differences in **elevation** can help when trying to region-guess Uruguay. The highest hills are mostly concentrated around two areas: - Near Minas, east of Montevideo. - North of Tacuarembo, in the far north of the country.\n- The landscape near the town of Minas is recognizable: some of the **tallest hills** in the country, with lots of **exposed rocks**, and often heavy bushland vegetation. The image shown here is a fairly extreme example of this landscape, used for illustration purposes – usually it is more subtle. However, the exposed rock is always a good clue. NOTE: The landscape in the Quebrada de los Cuervos nature reserve, situated further north, can look similar. In addition, there are also very tall hills in the north of the country. However, these look different (see the tip below).\n- You can also find tall hills in the north of the country. These can be recognized by their noticeably **darker soil**. These hills also typically do not have the exposed rocks that are visible in the Minas hills. The vegetation tends to be natural, and you will often see **tree plantations**. This specific landscape tends to be most noticeable very close to the Brazil border, on Route 30 near Tranqueras.\n- **Tree plantations** are a defining feature of much of Uruguay’s countryside, but they are especially common in two areas in the north and northwest. Note that the highest density of plantations is in these areas, but more isolated plantations can be found all over the country.\n- The region near Lagoa Mirim and the Brazil border in the southeast of the country is noticeably **very flat**, in contrast to the slight hills found in most of the rest of the country.\n- There are only a couple of **divided highways** in Uruguay, all of which are close to Montevideo: - Ruta 1 going west out of Montevideo, up until Colonia Valdense. - Ruta IB going east out of Montevideo, up until Punta del Este. - A short section of Ruta 5 going north out of Montevideo, up until Canelones. The only exceptions to this are some divided avenues in urban areas, which should be easy to distinguish from actual highways.\n- These bins with **orange lids are** specific to Rocha Department. However, you can still find these black bins in both the Rocha and Canelones Department."

Its relatively massive size may not always be as apparent in its suburbs. However, if you are in a densely populated, highly built-up area, consider guessing in downtown Montevideo, as there are very few places like that in other parts of Uruguay.\n- **Punta del Este** is a seaside resort town with a recognizable look. It is an affluent and touristic place with a developed downtown that consists of many tall, modern apartment buildings. Its main attraction is its large, sandy beach. Further away from the downtown area, you will see less highrises, but still a lot of expensive-looking villa neighbourhoods. Here, you will often see distinctive tall pine trees.\n- The small island of **Isla de Flores** is located off the coast of Montevideo. It has a trekker where you can see abandoned buildings, and usually also the lighthouse.\n- This unique Google car is found in the coastal town of **Cabo Polonio**. It can be recognized by the orange strap on the left. The coverage is an off-road trekker line on the map. The town that it drives through has a unique vibe, consisting of makeshift-looking shacks, scattered around the seaside landscape. In some of the coverage, the car drives on the beach.\n- This unique Google car is found in the **Valle del Lunarejo** natural park, located west of the town of Tranqueras. The car has a white front and a curved black backside with a brown strap. The coverage is an off-road trekker line on the map. The car drives on a small track through a grassy landscape. NOTE: This park only shows up as a point of interest on the map, instead of the usual dark green polygon used for natural parks."

Words are generally somewhat short, typically consisting of a **single syllable**.\n- The most common bollard type is a small square concrete bollard that is painted **white with a red top**.\n- The posts of road signs are usually painted with a **red and white stripe** pattern.\n- Road signs have a **yellow-orange background**. Within southeast Asia, this is unique.\n- Waystones that are painted white with a **colourful top**, usually red or blue, are common throughout the country.  NOTE: Waystones like these are also common in Thailand and Cambodia. Often, they will include the road number in a large font on the side, and in a smaller font in the red area on the back and front. In addition, the front and back will list distances to towns. This information can be really helpful with pinpointing.\n- Chevrons are either **black on yellow** or **white on red** and typically only have one arrow.\n- Directional signs are typically blue with either a very thin white border or no border at all. The signs usually contain white arrows, which rather than being orthogonal often point in slightly strange directions.\n- While multiple different types of road lines, both white and yellow, can be found in Vietnam, unusually **short yellow middle dashes** are particularly common and distinct.\n- Minor roads made of **concrete blocks** are very common in Vietnam. NOTE: This is also common in both the Philippines and Thailand, and to a lesser extent in Indonesia.\n- Red and white striped concrete safety barriers are somewhat common on mountain roads.\n- **Holey poles**, with holes either only on the lower half or almost all the way to the top, are common in Vietnam. NOTE: The only other Asian country that commonly has holey poles is Sri Lanka, where the holes are significantly larger.\n- Vietnam often has round concrete poles with indents and **small pin holes** near the top. NOTE: The same type of pole is also common in Cambodia.\n- Poletops shaped like **upside down trapezoids** are common in Vietnam. NOTE: These may look similar to the poletops found in central and northern Sulawesi, Indonesia.\n- Double poles, which can be of different varieties, are fairly common in Vietnam.\n- Utility poles often feature these light grey **electricity boxes**, which can have anywhere from 1 to 4 small indented windows. They have a very characteristic shape, where the bottom part** slopes down **slightly.\n- Vietnam has a fair amount of **motorcycle coverage**. This can be recognized by the unique shape of the car blur, which vaguely resembles the shape of a bone, and extends slightly higher up on one side. Sometimes you will only see the helmet of the motorcyclist. There is both Generation 3 and Generation 4 motorcycle coverage. Vietnam has by far the most motorcycle coverage in the world. In particular, if you see this type of coverage in a rural place, you are almost guaranteed to be in Vietnam.\n- **Shitcam** can be found in some areas of Vietnam.

                "description": "- **Addresses on signs** are _extremely _common in Vietnam, in particular on storefronts. These addresses follow a hierarchical sequence that usually goes from specific (house/building) to general (city/province). These can be tremendously helpful to find your exact location. Usually an address will contain all or some of the following elements, from left to right: - House and street number - Ward/commune: - - Ward (urban areas): **phường** - - Commune (rural areas): **xã** - District: - - Urban district: **quận** - - Rural district: **huyện** - - District level town: **thị xã** - - Municipal/provincial city:** thành phố** - Province/City - - Province: **tỉnh** - - Municipality: **thành phố **(a municipality in Vietnam is a city that is on the same administrative level as a province, such as Ha Noi, or Hải Phòng) These words are often abbreviated. For example, huyện can be abbreviated as just H., thành phố as just TP., etc. Additionally, sometimes the province itself may be abbreviated, for instance here Thái Bình is abbreviated as TB.\n- The **provinces** are the most useful part of an address. They are easy to scan for on the map, but it is recommended to learn them by heart to find them even quicker on the map.  Often, the names of provinces are abbreviated. For example, Tien Giang is abbreviated TG. These can be especially useful to learn by heart to get an edge over your opponent. It is important to note that Vietnam is currently undergoing an administrative reform, combining most provinces into larger provinces, reducing the number of provinces significantly. Google hasn’t updated its map to reflect this change yet, but it is expected to happen soon. This makes learning the provinces by heart even more important: the overwhelming majority of coverage will be from before the administrative reform, meaning that in the near future, you cannot simply scan the map for some of the provinces’ names. There are lots of resources available to learn the province names and abbreviations. We recommend https://helloquiz.app/.\n- **Area codes** in Vietnam always start with a 2, followed by one or two more digits, which are generally ordered from north to south.\n- Vietnamese licence plate codes, which are often painted onto the sides of trucks and other vehicles, are another useful clue to figure out the region.\n- Some place name prefixes, meaning the start of a city name, are regional within Vietnam.\n- Wide open and **completely flat agricultural fields** are most commonly seen in the Red River Delta and somewhat less commonly found in the Mekong River Delta.\n- The Mekong Delta is an exceedingly flat, water-rich area. It is traversed by numerous very **straight canals**, often flanked by linear villages. It is one of the most densely populated parts of Vietnam, with cultivated fields essentially everywhere. The area is even more tropical than the rest of Vietnam, with lots of palm trees** **and lush wetland vegetation.\n- The **Central Highlands** region tends to have a landscape with a somewhat distinct vibe: often hilly with distant mountains, red soil, and often fairly dry, rolling agricultural fields. Additionally, the vegetation is a bit drier than in the rest of Vietnam (depending on the season).\n- **Rubber tree plantations** are primarily found in the provinces to the north of Ho Chi Minh City, as well as in several parts of the Central Highlands. Rubber trees can be recognized by their thin trunks. In Vietnam, it is typical for a section of the tree trunk to be wrapped in a piece of plastic. These trees tend to be neatly organized in a dense grid-like pattern.\n- **Tea plantations** are primarily found in the north, limited to several disconnected areas.  A major exception is the southern province of Lâm Đồng, which has a large tea area centred around the city of Bảo Lộc. Tea plants can be recognized by their compact and neatly trimmed shape, with small dark green leaves. They are often, but not always, planted in windy rows on hillsides.\n- Clusters of Khasi pines growing on hills are very typical of far northeastern Vietnam, specifically the provinces of Lạng Sơn and Quảng Ninh.\n- **Dragonfruit** farms are mostly found in two small areas in the south:  - around the city of Phan Thiết in Bình Thuận province - a small area on the border between Long An and Tiền Giang, northeast of Mỹ Tho . Dragonfruit resembles the end of an upturned wet mop.\n- The coastal region northeast of Phan Thiết city is noticeably **dry and sandy**, compared to the typical Vietnamese landscape. Some parts of this region are very rocky as well.\n- **Black pepper** plantations are common in the area in and around the Central highlands. Black pepper is a type of vine that is cultivated on tree trunks: the pepper plants shroud these trees with a dense cover of downward-pointing leaves, completely obscuring the tree’s trunk.\n- Wind turbines can be found in a few clusters mainly in the southern half of the country. Here are the clusters from most to least common: - Southeast of Dalat, near the coast - North of Buon Ma Thuot, Dak lak - South of Pleiku, Gia Lai - Southeast of Dong Hoi, Quang Binh - East of Quy Nhon, Binh Dinh - South of Ho Chi Minh City, near the coast. - Western Quang Tri province.\n- Thin **spires on the roofs** of houses are almost exclusively found in the northern half of the country.\n- Houses in the Red River Delta (the flat, densely populated area around Hanoi) tend to have a **boxy** look, typically tall with **multiple storeys**. These houses often feature gaudy details that borrow heavily from antique Greco-Roman architecture: pillars, pediments, classical-looking balconies, etc. Note that similar houses are sometimes found in the direct vicinity of Ho Chi Minh City.\n- Houses in the Mekong Delta also have a boxy, concrete look, but are usually much less tall: they almost always consist of just a single, ground-level storey.\n- **Traditional wooden houses** are common in the northwest. They commonly have one or several of the following features: - Stilts holding up the house, - corrugated metal roofs, - triangular openings on the side of the roofs.\n- **Single graves** in the middle of agricultural fields can be found in the Red River Delta.\n- **Wooden fences** made out of sticks, or even bamboo, in a grid-like pattern, similar to fences commonly found in northeastern India, are found in the northern parts of Vietnam.\n- Utility poles with **large holes** along most of the pole are common in northern Vietnam. NOTE: Do not confuse this with the regular holey pole, which is where the holes extend only halfway up the pole. This ½ of the holey pole is found throughout the entirety of Vietnam.\n- Round concrete poles usually feature many pinholes on the top half of the pole, however in the north they often feature a minimal amount or even **no pinholes**. NOTE: Although more rare, pinhole poles may be found in the north.\n- Poletops shaped like **upside down trapezoids** are common in central and northern Vietnam. NOTE: Trapezoidal pole tops may be off-centre which is not the same as regular off-centre poles.\n- The trapezoid shaped poletops can sometimes be off-centre. If a utility pole has **three off-centre incomplete trapezoids** then you will be in the north of the country.\n- Poletops shaped like a **triangle**, with the support bars underneath the crossbar, are found in southern Vietnam. NOTE: The middle insulator must be mounted onto the pole itself, rather than on a metal extension of the crossbar.\n- A poletop shaped like an **A above a crossbar** can be found in the centre of the country.\n- Utility poles with **uneven crossbars**, meaning the crossbar is significantly more to one side of the pole than the other, are found in the south of the country. Sometimes, they are not fully uneven but are more in the style of Indonesian off-centre poles. NOTE: You may mistake partially off-centre trapezoid poletops for regular off-centre poletops, however any pole with a trapezoid connector belongs in a different category. In the exception, the connector is not a straight bar, rather it is an incomplete trapezoid.\n- Thin **bamboo poles** can be found in rural areas of the northwestern mountains.\n- Poles in the northern parts of the country will often have **black pole stickers**, similar to those found in Malaysia but often with a more simple design.\n- Shitcam is only found in a few spots in the Red River Delta."

NOTE: The broader region of northern Vietnam is also characterized by pointy mountains. The Geopark is unique because of the exposed rocks.\n- The island of Phú Quốc is found in southern Vietnam near Cambodia. Phú Quốc only has Generation 3 coverage and has a lot of dark red soil. You may sometimes see a large forested ridge, which sits northeast on the island.\n- On the coastal roads of the Hạ Long Bay, east of Hải Phòng, you can see numerous **pointy, rocky islands** rising out of the water, making for idyllic views.\n- A **single large mountain** in the middle of an otherwise completely flat landscape can be found just northeast of the city of Tây Ninh.\n- This peninsula in far northern Khánh Hoà can be recognised by the many **sand dunes** hugging the road, which is mostly a divided highway, but also a smaller paved road for a shorter stretch.\n- The historic town of Hội An, just south of Da Nang, can be recognised by the **old yellow buildings** typically with dark brown doors and details.\n- Sa Pa is a resort town deep in the northern mountains overflowing with touristy stores and restaurants with excessive signage, and palace-like grand hotels throughout the town. The architecture is a mixture of an affluent European style and a more typical southeast Asian style.\n- Near the beach resorts just east of Phan Thiết city, most signs will have **Cyrillic text** alongside Vietnamese, catering to Russian tourists."
